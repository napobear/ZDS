Jumper settings for baby M68k CPU board version 1.0.002
 
     Jumper          Schematic          Setting

      J1                 p. 5               Flash:  1-2 & 3-4     (see schematic)
                                            EPROM:  1-3 & 2-4

      J2                 p. 7               3-5 & 4-6   (most conservative)   (I/O wait states:  rd = 2 w.s., wr = 3 w.s.)
                                            or [1-3 & 2-4]   (I/O wait states:  rd = 1 w.s., wr = 2 w.s.)

      J3                 p. 7               2-3          (most conservative)  (Memory wait states:  write = 1 w.s.)
                                            or [1-2]     (memory write = 0 w.s.)

      J4                 p. 8               off         (no external memory beyond 0x300000)
                                            on          (external board with memory up to 0x380000)


Jumpers added for Mini-M68K CPU board, version 2.0-007

      J5		 p. 6               1-2 (default)  N8VEM behavior for bus /RESET pin (output from board to peripherals)
					    2-3          Kontron behavior (input to board from Reset switch)

      J9	      	 p. 8		    off     (version 1 compatible; i.e., no low memory write protection; J7, J8, J10 ignored)
				            on	    Enable User Mode low memory Write-Protection

  Low Memory protected range:

	J7      J8       p. 5

	on	on		 1K
	off	on		 4K	    (many User Mode programs start at 0x1000)
	off	off		64K


      J10		 p. 5		    on		(enable generation of /BERR on illegal write)
					    off		(write-protect still active, but no /BERR generated)
 

 

It is strongly suggested that you consult the schematic pages to confirm
the jumper settings that you want to use.  J2/J3 may be altered for fewer
wait states; the above defaults are the most conservative settings.
