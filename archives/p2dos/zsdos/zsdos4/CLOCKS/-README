This library contains files to create the CLOCKS.DAT file.  Scripts are
provided ZEX (filetype .ZEX) for both ZMAC and SLR180 assembly.  NULU or
an equivalent library manager should be used to add the assembled and
renamed clocks to the library.  The sequence should be:

 1. Assemble (ASMCLKS.ZEX or SLRCLKS.ZEX)
 2. Rename (RENCLKS.ZEX)
 3. Add members to CLOCKS.DAT library (LIBCLKS.ZEX/LIBCLKS.NCF)
 4. Delete discrete clocks after adding to library (KILLREL.ZEX)
