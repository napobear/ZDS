ZXD - A Z-System Directory List Program.		18 July 2001

ZXD will list the contents of directorys on CP/M disks in a variety of
formats.  The major advantages over other programs is that the display
sizes the amount of information to screen parameters set in a ZCPR 3.x
Termcap, can recognze the WHEEL byte to restrict displays for remotely
accessed systems, and can display file date stamp information from
DateStamper(tm), DosDisk(tm), CP/M+ (P2DOS) and NZTIME formats.

Version 2.2 corrects the following and/or adds capabilities as:

 - fixes an occasional glitch which did not display stamp information
	for certain files
 - Cleans up display on Printer output
 - Tailors display to Termcap info for number of lines and columns
