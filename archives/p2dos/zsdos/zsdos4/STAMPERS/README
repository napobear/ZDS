These are the files needed to produce stamping modules for ZSDOS and
the clock driver for ZDDOS.  While the original release only supported
DateStamper and P2DOS (CP/M+ compatible) file stamps, Joe Wright's
NZTime stamps was added later.  The version of SETUPZST in this package
supports all three stamp types.

NOTE: The Dual P2DOS/NZTime module has not been field tested.

The ZEX script details the assembly and "libraryizing" steps needed
to make a new STAMPS.DAT file using Al Hawley's ZMAC and NULU.
