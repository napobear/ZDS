BIOS Revision 6 for the Commodore 128 is an updated CP/M BIOS that is
faster and provides more features than the BIOS provided by Commodore.
Some of the new functions and features include a screen dump, support
for more disk formats and improved speed for most operations.  This
was accomplished by removing code for driving the 40 column screen,
which few serious CP/M users have never seen.
<p>
This is release #2 of CP/M Plus BIOS Revision 6 for the Commodore 128.
If you have an earlier copy of BIOS-R6, you have probably had problems
getting it to assemble without errors.  The files in this release
should assemble properly.
<p>
Other minor changes were made to set the drive search path to "A:,*
[TEMP=A:]" so it should run straight "out of the box" on all systems.
More comments were added throughout the source code to make it easier
to customize the system.
<p>
A long standing C128 CP/M bug was fixed.  The bug causes keyboard
input to mess up after exiting from a terminal program.  See the docs
and CXIO.ASM for more information.

<! A little trick :-) 

Add these lines to each of your web pages. There are programs that
'crawl' the Internet, scanning web pages for email addresses. When
they copy these addresses, and add them to a mailing list, and send
mail to it, these will result in their generating email to their own
ISPs :-).. These lines will not show up on your web page screen.

You must add the character ' < ' right before each ' a href '.
Explaining it like this was the only way I could get them to display
here :-)
