This is an overlay file for NSWP207 that adds support for Z80DOS 
time-stamping. It will allow NSWP to carry the create and 
alteration date of the source file(s) to the destination file(s)
for single and mass file copies; and the creation date for
squeeze/unsqueeze/reverse. It expects to be overlayed on the
original distribution without any other patches.
