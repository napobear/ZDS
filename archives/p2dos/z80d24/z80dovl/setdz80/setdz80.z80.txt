;	Patches SETD22.COM for use with Z80DOS written
;	June 29, 1988 by Eugene Nolan

;	From the original:
;	February 11, 1988 by Bruce Morgen

;	Patch  and overlay file for SETD20.  To use,  modify EURO and
;	OVERWR bytes as desired.  If your system has a clock, you may
;	code a routine to get the date at getdate.  If you do so, you
;	should change the byte at  DATEREQ to 0.  Otherwise, leave it
;	at 0FFh.

;	Assemble to SETDZ80.HEX with ZAS, Z80ASM, Z80MR (rename this file
;	to SETDZ80.AZM for Z80MR), etc.	Load with Ron Fowler's MLOAD:

;		MLOAD SETD.COM,SETDZ80

	ORG	100H
	DS	3		; Leave here (space for jmp to start of
				; SETD itself)
EUROMODE:
	DB	0		; Change to 0FFh for default euro mode
				; [don't change for this overlay unless
				; you reverse the (MONTH) & (DAY) loads
				; on lines 45 & 47! - b/m]
OVERWRMODE:
	DB	0		; Change to 0FFh for default overwr mode

DATE:	DW	0		; This is where the system date should go.

DATEREQ:DB	0		; If you code a routine below to access the
				; System date, or use the CPM/3 function
				; Below, you must change this to 0.

GETDATE:;RET			; And delete this RET!

;	ADDING CLOCK SUPPORT:
;
;	Support for a system clock may be added here. If your system has
;	a clock, simply add the routine to access it. You have about 127
;	bytes in which to do so.  The format of the date is an integer
;	number of days since January 1, 1978.  This number must be placed
;	in DATE, above.

	LD	C,105		; Z80DOS call for get time
	LD	DE,JDAY		; Put it here
	CALL	005H
	LD	HL,(JDAY)	; Z80DOS stores Julian Day, so get it
	LD	(DATE),HL	; And put it where SETD22 wants it
	LD	A,H
	OR	A,L
	RET	NZ		; NZ means Time was set
	LD	DE,TIMMES
	LD	C,9
	CALL	005H
	RST	0

JDAY:	DS	5

timmes:
	db 0dh,0ah,'Time Not Set, Aborting',0dh,0ah,'$'

;	This routine must end before GETDATE+7Fh
