4.0 (release) - 1 Apr 89			Harold F. Bower
  Minor Code Optimizations and cosmetic source polishing

4.1 (Test) - 23 Jul 89				Harold F. Bower
  Significant rewrites and Optimizations

4.2 - 23 Sep 89					Harold F. Bower
  Additional Optimization of BDOS & BIOS Interfaces.  Split into increased
	number of modules to reduce linked pgm size.

4.2a - 28 Oct 89				Harold F. Bower
  Bug fixes, generalized for assembly/linkage by ZMAC and SLR family of tools.

4.3 - 18 Aug 90					Harold F. Bower/Joe Wright
  Fixed EVALxx routines, added optimizations of JWW.

4.3a - 29 Sep 90				Harold F. Bower
  Fixed errors in SORT and incorporated ideas from Carson Wilson.

4.3b - 26 Nov 90				Hal Bower/Joe Wright
  SORT - Completely redone by Joe Wright.  MUCH faster and smaller.  It has
	replaced the embedded sorts used in the directory routines.
  SSBINIT - Now initializes the pointers (if used) instead of SORT.  Not used
	if you are sorting actual records.
  DIRALPHA/DBUFFER/DIRQ/DIRQS - Now use the general sort routine SORT and
	SSBINIT instead of a unique sort routine.
  MULT/DIV - Completely redone by Joe Wright.  MUCH faster
  ARGV - Redone by Joe Wright.  Now works and smaller
  COUT7 - Now preserves MSB in A
  GFA - Two bytes shorter thanks to Howard Goldstein
