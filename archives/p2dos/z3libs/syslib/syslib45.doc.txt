  This library contains the source code for SYSLIB Version 4.5 approved for
release for Non-Commercial purposes by Joe Wright, the Copyright holder.  The
individual files are compressed with CRLZH version 2.0.
  Two ZEX scripts are included for assembling all the modules with either SLR's
Z80ASMP or Al Hawley's ZMAC, and another two for linking the modules with
either the SLR linker or MicroSoft's LIB80.  To use these copy or rename them
to type .ZEX and execute them as a ZEX script.
