        The purpose of this code is to kludge up a solution to the problem
        of certain programs wiping out ZRDOS public directory definitions.
        It has been tested with ZCPR 3.3 and ZRDOS 1.7. It may or may not
        work with other versions of this o/s, though judging by my ZRDOS docs
        it should work with versions that go as far back as 1.2 (first public
        ZRDOS?), and I see no good reason why it shouldn't work with other
        versions of ZCPR.           Al Grabauskas   01/20/88
