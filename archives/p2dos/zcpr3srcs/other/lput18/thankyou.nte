LPUT is available to the user community by courtesy of
ON! Systems, Inc.  ON! supports the development of new
CP/M compatible hardware and is the manufacturer of the
ON! Computer, a ramdisk-based high-performance system
that deserves the interest of the user community.  For
more information about the remarkable ON!, call Bill
Elliot at 312-680-4680.  I think you'll be more than
impressed.  To Bill and the rest of the ON! crew:
thank you, gentlemen!
