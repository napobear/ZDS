
	This library contains the NHSH program written by J. Poplett
modified to execute at 8000h under ZCPR33. The .REL file is included
to allow the use of other high memory execution addresses.

	The only modifications to the original program are the type 3
environment header and changing the prompt to '>>' as an indication
that a shell is in control.

	For those unfamiliar with HSH or NHSH I have included NHSH.HLP

	I originally made the type 3 environment changes to NHSH as
a temporary fix until the original author released an official ZCPR33
version. However, since several months have passed since the release of
ZCPR33 and I have not seen such a version on any BBS; I have decided to
release my 'temporary' version.  PLEASE note that I do not have the source
code to NHSH and can not support it. If you have any problems in its use,
try out the 'original' NHSH and see if the problem persists; or try using
a lower load address. NHSH uses a rather large buffer which may cause
problems for those with small tpa's. (It requires 10k bytes for the
history buffer and NHSH.VAR buffer.)
