 ZHLPNCF1.NCF is a simple little ditty inspired by Bob Dean's 
 automation of Bill Tishey's prodigious Z3HELP libraries. This 
 file is based on NULU's little known console input-output 
 redirection capabilities. Use with NULU152A and read the NULU152 
 *.DOC files first. This is intended to be used as a "Z-System" 
 ALIAS.  Later versions will also "chain" to ZFILER, ZMANG etc. I 
 still think NULU is more powerful than VLU! Enjoy TP.
