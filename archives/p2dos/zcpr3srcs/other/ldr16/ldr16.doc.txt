LDR Version 1.6 -- ZCPR3 Package Loader -- March 3, 1987

  Version 1.6 adds the ability to read files from a library 
to LDR.  This is significantly faster than loading them as 
seperate files (especially on hard disk systems) and since 
each package is less than 1k, it makes quite a lot of sense 
to group them in libraries.

  The idea of this new version was Jay Sage's, and I did the 
programming.
