   CVIDLIB is a library of ZCPR3 video screen  handling routines written in C.
C programmers  can use  these  routines  to  make  generic 'calls' to terminal
routines and have the program work on any ZCPR3 machine.

   Included in  the library  is  the trick  to  show  how to  make any program 
written under C/80 become an instant ZCPR3 utility.

   The linker used  with  this programming  method  must be LINK.COM.  This is
the Digital  Research linker.  It appears  to be  the only one which will load
the code segment before the data segment.
