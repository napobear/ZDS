CMDRUN Notes:

   a. LRUNZ --> CMDRUN
    
      CMDRUN can be useful on systems with limited disk space by alllowing
      one to group .COM files into a library (.LBR) and to run such files
      from the library.  Rename LRUNZ3.COM to CMDRUN.COM and place on A15:.
      Then, create a library file of the COM files you want named COMMAND.LBR
      and place on A15:.  Any of the COM files in COMMAND.LBR can then be
      invoked by just entering their name.

   b. LX --> CMDRUN
 
      One can access libraries other than the conventional default COMMAND.LBR
      by renaming LX.COM to CMDRUN.COM and placing a dash immediately before 
      the directory and library name.  For example:  lx -b9:asm libzas<cr>
      causes the program LIBZAS to run from ASM.LBR in directory B9:.  You
      must declare the directory (either du: or dir:), however, even if the 
      library is on the logged-in directory.


CMDRUN Notes (continued):

   c. ARUNZ --> CMDRUN

      ARUNZ is probably the most versatile extended command processor.  
      With ARUNZ renamed to CMDRUN, aliases, placed in ALIAS.CMD, will run 
      simply by typing their name.  In addition, you can run programs from 
      COMMAND.LBR by creating specific aliases in ALIAS.CMD to invoke them.
      'RARELY LX RARELY $*', for example, will run RARELY.COM in COMMAND.LBR.
      Or, you can chain to LX from the ARUNZ ALIAS.CMD file by placing 
      ':LX $0 $*' on the last line of ALIAS.CMD.
      
   d. Under ZCPR3.3, the name of the ECP is assembled into the command
      processor (CMDRUN is default).  If ROOTONLY is turned on, the CCP will 
      look only in the area specified as the last element in the symbolic
      path.  If CMDRUN is not there, the error handler will be invoked.
