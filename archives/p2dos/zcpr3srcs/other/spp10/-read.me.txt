 This program, SPP, has been tested on a plain vanilla CPM machine
and also on a ZCPR33/Z80DOS machine and has worked with the
equates set correctly. I do not know if it will work on MPM,CPM+,
if it does, please let me know. I know it will not work on CPM1.4
systems.
 It has been assembled with SLR Z80ASM, Microsoft M80, and DRI MAC,
if you have problems with any others, please let me know. It has as
it's base as SDZD134.ASM, and there have been reports of assembly 
problems with LASM and ASM. I have incorporated the changes required
so that it should assemble with those assemblers now. There is also
a new release of SDZD coming out with smarter date math and also
incorporating the changes to work with LASM/ASM. This should be out
in the next 2-3 weeks.
