; PROGRAM:  DU3
; AUTHOR:  RICHARD CONN
; DERIVATION:  DUTIL is derived from DU Version 7.5
;		DU2 is derived from DUTIL Version 1.1
;		DU3 is derived from DU2 Version 1.1
;
; version 1.4	1/1/88
;	-	Map command now packs the directory, removing erased
;		entries.  This should allow larger disks to be mapped, and
;		also should form the basis for the more powerful directory
;		packing scheme suggested by Jay Sage in DU314.UPD.
;	-	Fixed max. user number bug.  Unn command was giving 
;		error for ZCPR ENV max user of nn.
;	-	Added permanent macros to version 1.3CW.
;	-	Directory timestamps no longer recognized in Map command.
;	-	DJNZ macro reinstated because its removal was causing trouble. 
;	-	Adapted DU313CW help screens for reverse video. 
;	-	Now links with DSEG.
;
;							- Carson Wilson <crw>
; Version:  1.3
;		Modified by Jay Sage to incorporate a set of permanent
;		macros.  These macros can be invoked by the command tail
;		when DU is invoked.  They are copied from a space of 128
;		bytes near the beginning of the code.  The area is
;		identified by a string of text to facilitate patching.
;		The macros are listed one after another, separated by
;		carriage return characters.  Macros that are not to be
;		defined must be present as carriage returns alone or the
;		program will fail.  The help screen code was pulled out into
;		an include file and modified to give a reasonable appearance
;		on a reverse-video screen.
;
; VERSION:  1.3CW  11 September 1987
;
;		Translate to Z80 opcodes and lower case, 
;		allow disks with directory time stamps with
;		map command, add "," and "." for edit plus/minus 
;		block command, replace help completely, 
;		clean up various displays, remove djnz macro, so
;		for Z80 cpu only.  Removed embedded tabs from	
;		db opcodes.  All changes marked <crw>.

;  Key comments from DU V7.5 and DU3 follow --
;
;This version of DU is compatible with CP/M 2.x
;and does not require alteration for various hardware
;configurations.  It adjusts itself automatically to
;the correct number of sectors, tracks, directory size,
;etc.  It has been tested on 5-1/4" and 8" floppy, and
;10 megabyte hard disk systems.
;
;Because of the automatic adaption feature, no conditional
;assembly options are included.
;
;*************************************************
;* 						 *
;*   This program has been heavily modified	 *
;* to allow it to work without modification	 *
;* on all versions of CP/M 2.x.			 *
;*   One known possible problem involves the	 *
;* system tracks on some systems, and results	 *
;* from the system sectors being skewed. There	 *
;* is NO way for a program executing under CP/M	 *
;* to know about this.  This program assumes the *
;* standard convention of no skew being used on	 *
;: the system tracks. This usually isn't a prob- *
;* lem because the SYSGEN program can be used to *
;* get the system from the disk so that	it can	 *
;* be modified.					 *
