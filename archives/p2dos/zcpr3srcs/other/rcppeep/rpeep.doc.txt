; +++++++	NOT an official RCP segment for Z33RCP.Z80
;		This is a hacker's module intended to work with Z33RCP.

; Command:	PEEP
; Function:	Text File Browser and Lister
; Comments:	The CRT protocol has to be hard coded into this module.
;		If the TCAP were used, PEEP would not be practical.
;		PEEPSECURE equate determines where the file is loaded.

; Usage:	Hands rest on the home row of keys.  Left hand moves ahead
;		through text, right hand moves back.

The text movement commands should be self-demonstrating.  I hope with a
minute or two practice, they become easy enough to use.

If the entire file will not fit in memory, a message is printed.  The 'R'
command will then read in the next TPA sized chunk of the file with one
screen of overlap.  If there is no more to be read, you can start over at
the beginning.

The 'O' command sets a place marker to the top of the current screen.  You can
return to it with a '0'.  The marker is also used as the start of the block
to be listed with the 'P' command.  The end of the block is the bottom of the
current screen.  A prompt will ask if you really want to do a listing to
1) give you a chance to recover from an accidental key strike, 2) make sure
the printer is on, 3) think one last time about where the marker is:  it
is initialized to the start of the text.  A printer initialization string
can be installed if desired.

Sorry about not using the TCAP video.  Aside from the problem of no "insert
line" sequence, the access routines would make PEEP unwieldy.  (Since I only
have one terminal, I prefer to customize the routine rather than do without.)

The CRT requirements are:

	COMMAND		DEFAULT
	-------		-------
	CLS		1A
	EREOL		ESC,'T'
	GOTOXY		ESC,'=',row+32,col+32
	INSERT LINE	ESC,'E'
	HOME CURSOR	1E
	STAND OUT	ESC,')'		;optional
	STAND END	ESC,'('		;optional

The source file contains instructions for setting up the video sequences.

;
; PEEP EQUATES
;

PEEPGO	EQU	NO		; Insert jump instruction to PEEP at 100h

The text is normally read into the TPA at 100h.  If an object file were
read, (the display would be garbage), one could exit and execute the file
with a GO command.  If there is some reason to avoid this possibility,
PEEPGO	EQU  YES  inserts a jump instruction to the PEEP code in the RCP
and then reads the text to 103h and above.  So a GO will only restart PEEP.


END PEEP.DOCtion to the PEEP code in the RCP
and then reads the
