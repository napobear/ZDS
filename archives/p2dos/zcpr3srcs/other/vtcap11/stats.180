; STATS
; 
; Statistics routine to calculate and determine the various values
; needed from each file read into memory. We need to compute the
; total number of entries in each index buffer, the current version
; number of the file in the buffer and the offset necessary to be 
; able to read from the disk file.
;

; GCNT - Get total number of records in index buffer
;
; EXIT	HL = Number of terminals in file

gcnt:	ld	hl,(ebuf)	; get end of buffer
	dec	hl
	ld	(buf),hl	; save new address
	ld	de,buf3		; get starting address of buffer
	sbc	hl,de		; compute length of buffer
	ld	de,16		; length of each entry
	call	divhd		; compute number of entries
	dec	hl
	ret

; GVSN - Get the current version number of the file in use
;
; ENTRY	DE = Pointer to storage of version number

gvsn:	ld	hl,(buf)	; get end of buffer
	ld	bc,4		; length of version number
	ldir			; move to preallocated buffer
	ret

; GRECOF - Get the necessary offset to access the records in the disk file
;
; EXIT 	HL = record offset for data in TCAP file

grecof:	ld	de,8		; number of entries per 128 bytes
	call	divhd		; compute number of 128 byte blocks in file
	inc	hl		; go to next block
	ret
