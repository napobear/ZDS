; GNVER
;
; The following routine takes care of the renaming of the different
; files on exit from the various functions in VTCAP. The MERGE function
; creates file called MERGE.TCP, the ADD function creates a file called
; ADD.TCP and a scratch file called TCAP.ADD. Durring ADD or MERGE, the 
; version number is obtained from VERBUF (decimal omitted) and a new 
; filename called Z3TCAPxx is created where xx is the version number. 
; Before creating the file, the default directory is searched for the 
; existance of the file. If it exists, it is renamed to Z3TCAPxx.BAK 
; and then either MERGE.TCP (from MERGE) or ADD.TCP (from ADD) is renamed
; to Z3TCAPxx.TCP. After all of this, the scratch file (TCAP.ADD) is then
; erased from the disk. 
;
; NOTE: The DELETE function also uses the code from this routine.
; 	When exiting from the delete function, all non-deleted
;	records are written to a file called MERGE.TCP. The procedure
;	is the same for this file.
