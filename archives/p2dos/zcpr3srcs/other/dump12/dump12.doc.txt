DUMP is a ZCPR3 utility that displays a disk file on the console 
in hexadecimal and ASCII, at sixteen bytes per line, with 
automatic screen paging.

USAGE:

	DUMP {dir:}<fn.ft> {/}{<options>}

A filename is required.  If a DIR or DU specification is not 
given then the current drive and user is assumed.

Relative addresses (beginning at 0000h) are displayed at the 
beginning of each line, unless the filetype is COM, when 
addresses begin at an offset of 100h.  Scrolling pauses after a 
page (two sectors) is displayed.  Any key displays the next page. 
A ^C cancels the display.

OPTIONS:  A slash before options is okay, but not required.  Only 
one option is currently implemented.

     A    displays ASCII equivalents of bytes with the high bit
          set.

As with most ZCPR3 utilities, two slashes (//) or a null command 
tail displays a brief usage message.  Invalid options are ignored.
