ZDB 2.3 - Terry Hazen, Joe Mortensen 03/18/94

Syslib byte-oriented file output routines were replaced by routines
developed for ZFIND to free up space and allow appending to existing
files.	The added space was used to provide full du/dir:filename.ft
output filename specification while still keeping ZDB23.COM under 10k.
The default is the current datafile name with the appropriate filetype
in the currently logged directory.  If the specified file already
exists, you may specify that it be overwritten or that the selected
records be appended.  File output and label printing now have the same
record selection options available, including the ability to use Find,
XFind and Prev/Nxt to locate records.

Each address and return address field now has a termination routine
address associated with it, allowing greater flexibility in formatting
addresses and return addresses.

When labels are printed using any of the group printing option (All, Key
or Skip,) the current return address record, if any, will now be
skipped, as will all records with non-valid addresses.	A valid address
must have a city entry and at least one address entry.	This makes it
possible to keep records that contain only names and phone numbers
without having them printed as labels in mass label printings.

A new 'Skip' option has been added to label and output file routines to
include only records that don't match a specified key in the label or
file output.

The return address format has been modified slightly to print both
Address1 and Address2 on the second line to better accommodate address
records that use both address fields.  The return address is now read
into a return address buffer before labels or envelopes are printed
instead of being read each time a label or envelope is printed.  Label
addresses for addresses with country entries are now correctly bottom-
aligned.

Several minor bugs were also corrected.  Attempting to invoke ZDB with a
non-existing wildcard filename will now result in an error message.  All
WSF files now contain date headers.  File record pointer now maintained
properly when printing all label records.


ZDB 2.2 - Joe Mortensen, Terry Hazen 11/22/93

Modified search routines to allow repeat searches from the main menu
and label/envelope print menus using a '^L' or 'L' command.  Both Find
and XFind routines now provide searching on two search string keys.  For
example, the search strings 'TERRY' and 'HAZEN' will locate a record
with a first name field of 'Terry' and a last name field of 'Hazen'.
Improved record and menu display refreshes.


ZDB 2.1 - Terry Hazen 06/26/93

Fixed default drive header display problem.  Small new-line bug
corrected in ADR file output routine.  Added configuration byte to clear
screen on exit.  Clock display is now updated after each menu command
and display is configurable for 12hr or 24hr format.  Clock and record
number display is updated after each new record is added.  All file
output routines now include Print Current Record.  When printing labels
or envelopes, Find/XFind routines no longer dump you back at the main
menu.  Find/XFind searches now start at current record instead of the
first record and can now be aborted with an empty search string entry.
When the search string isn't found, both Find/XFind now return to the
current record rather than the first record.  File output routines now
also return to the current record after writing the file rather than the
first record.  CDF files now include the last-modified date for each
record as the last record field in the format "yy/mm/dd".


ZDB 2.0 - Terry Hazen 05/31/93

Made a small change to allow use of the corrected PDFCB11 parser from
JTHLIB15, which fixes a bug that had no effect on ZDB19.  Fixed a bug in
the label printing routine that caused the return address to be printed in
caps when more than one copy was printed.


ZDB 1.9 - Terry Hazen 05/22/93

Added new output text datafile format.	ADR file is an ASCII name and
address file that includes only the first 8 fields (first name through
country) in the normal name and address format.  The currently displayed
record may be written to an ADR file for inclusion in another document.

Added printed Postal Service DPBC barcodes to labels and envelopes.
DPBC barcodes will only be printed if the ZIP field contains a full 9-
digit ZIP+4 Zip Code.  Barcodes are printed using one or two passes of
120dpi dot graphics with from one to three overstrikes/pass.  Partial or
wildcard datafile name can now be entered from the command line.  If no
filetype is specified, the default filetype 'DTA' will be used.  CFG
file completely rewritten and barcode graphics configuration added.

The USPS recommends printing addresses in upper case.  Added a
configuration byte to allow configuring ZDB19 to print addresses in
mixed case, the distribution default, or in upper case.

Modified datafile parsing to use a new routine, PDFCB, from JTHLIB14.
PDFCB uses FNAMZ to fill the FCB with the default configurable datafile
du:fn.ft.  Then it takes any du:fn.ft command line tokens and moves them
to the FCB.  This allows you to specify any part of the datafile
du:fn.ft on the command line and have it override the default
configurable version.  Now asks before creating new datafile.

Cleaned up a few other loose ends.

ZDB 1.8c - Joe Mortensen April 12, 1992

A change in the dialer routine made by Hawley/Hazen prevented long
dialing strings with delays in them (like credit card calls) from going
through properly.  The MRESET call was coming too soon.  A longer delay
in TSTR fixed the bug.	The count given to the register was originally
40.  A change to 0 (making it in effect 256) solved the problem.


ZDB 1.8b - changes by Al Hawley 02/04/92

A "jr clkok" instruction was added at the end of the clkok: routine
after the call to fnamz to enable recognition of the DU spec in the
default data filename.	In ZDB18.B, added 2 instructions which send
"ATZ" to the modem after completion of dialing. This leaves the modem in
a well defined standard state for subsequent use by other communication
programs which may not reset the S7 register.

Bug fixes in this release:
     1.  A problem with editing after using the Find command has
been corrected.  The bug was creating a second record and
appending it to the file rather than changing the existing one.
     2.  Problems some users have with the formfeed after
printing labels has been fixed through elimination.  After each
label is printed the printer now gets a reset string to restore
the printer to its defaults.  The final formfeed after a label
printing session is gone.  This was never a problem to me, but
some users have complained and pleaded for mercy.  Now granted.

Changes in this release:
     1.  Default data file name may now have driver/user prefix
as part of it.	This is configurable with the CFG file.  Up to 16
characters may be in the file name.
     2.  I have gone back to a single version of ZDB rather than
separate ones for ZSDOS and Z3Plus.  V. 1.8 uses the DSLIB clock
routines for portability.

Problems not resolved:
     I received one note about a problem with zero length printer
strings.  I have not been able to duplicate the problem.  If you
run into this, please give me some details.
     Some users find that their printers can't handle both NLQ
and Emphasized print at the same time.	The distribution version
is set up this way.  If you have a problem, use CFG to change
your printer strings.
