February 23, 1988

This is a compilation of my writings appearing in Morrow Owners
Review other than my regular ZCPR3 column, "Forever Z," which are
contained in ZCOLUMNS.LBR, also released today.  It includes
reviews of the superb programs Backgrounder ii and DateStamper 
from Plu*Perfect Systems in Santa Monica, CA, and a review of the 
Mini-Winnie hard disk available from Advanced Concepts and 
Engineering in Boca Raton, Florida.

I have also included here my very first article from my tender
days of ZCPR3 when I first began in spring/summer 1986.  This
article actually was published, almost a year later, in the First
Osborne Group's CP/M magazine FOGHORN, I believe in the May or
June 1987 issue.  Let's hope, by the way, that the two superb new
products from Echelon will end the unfortunate isolation that has
existed for far too long between the Osborne and ZCPR3
communities.  ZCPR33 for CP/M Plus machines will allow Osborne
Executive users to run our superb O/S, and the new Z-COM will
take care of all the TPA problems that have heretofore prevented
Osbornes, with their memory-hungry but very valuable memory-
mapped video feature, from being able to satisfactorily implement
ZCPR3.  A big hurdle remains, however, for the large number of
Osborne owners using the Trantor software from WestWind which
implements its own CCP.  Despite Jack Brown's release of
TRANTCCP.LBR allowing implementation of ZCPR1 and 2 with the
WestWind software, work remains to be done before a full,
integrated configuration of ZCPR3 is available for machines using
WestWind equipment.

The files in this library have been crunched with the superb 
DateStamper-supporting CR23D, and their dates of creation are 
appropriate.  I hope at some point sysops start using LDIR-B 
instead of LUX or ZLUX, because the display of this library seen 
through that program is absolutely delightful.  All references in 
the UNCRUNCH "[text display]" (and therefore the LDIR-B comment 
field) to date of issue refer to the MOR issue date.
