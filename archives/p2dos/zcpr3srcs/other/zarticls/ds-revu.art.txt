     Back in the winter of 1986/87 during my regular†ç
†ç
transcontinental BBS travels I found myself constantly running†ç
†ç
across messages referring to two programs DateStamper and†ç
†ç
Backgrounder II, both by Plu*Perfect Systems in southern†ç
†ç
California, about which people seemed unable to stop raving. The†ç
†ç
course of discussion on one of my favorite bulletin boards in†ç
†ç
particular -- Newton Centre Z-Node in Boston -- had seemingly†ç
†ç
been given over entirely to these two programs for a period of†ç
†ç
several weeks. I was initially slow to take notice as I am often†ç
†ç
conservative when it comes to new software purchases. I have†ç
†ç
since acquired both programs, seen what a total change in my†ç
†ç
operations they provide, and now utilize them both on a daily†ç
†ç
basis. I would like in this issue to share some of my†ç
†ç
experiences with DateStamper, and next time deal with†ç
†ç
Backgrounder II.†ç


     It was actually only thanks to a minor catastrophe I had a†ç
†ç
few months ago, that DateStamper could have prevented, that I now†ç
†ç
understand what all the hubbub was all about. These two†ç
†ç
utilities add a major dimension to CP/M computing that has been†ç
†ç
sorely missing from our repertoire, and as such deserve our†ç
†ç
fullest support.†ç


     About three months ago I did something fairly outlandish†ç
†ç
with my system; I decided it was time to reformat my hard disk.†ç
†ç
The Mini-Winnie's response time was getting much slower than I†ç
†ç
remember it having been during the couple of months after first†ç
†ç
attaching it to my MD3. Of course all hard disks will do this†ç
†ç
eventually as segments of files become scattered over the disk.†ç
†ç
Methodically I backed up the entire 20 megabytes onto 50 floppies†ç
†ç
or so, reformatted, copied them back, and experienced no problems†ç
†ç
-- except for one minor detail. I maintain an 80k dBase II file†ç
†ç
of which for good measure I am constantly making several backups†ç
†ç
on to different floppies each time it is modified. Well, it†ç
†ç
turns out I had been less than zealous in marking on the floppies†ç
†ç
which version was the most recent. Result?  After the†ç
†ç
reformatting I had about 6 different versions of the same file†ç
†ç
staring me in the face, and I simply had no idea which one should†ç
†ç
assume its dutiful place on my hard disk. It took me about 2†ç
†ç
hours of visually comparing the data on each of these, running a†ç
†ç
"difference" utility on the files and phone calls to non-existent†ç
†ç
telephone numbers to see which was the most current.†ç


     Afterwards I had three or four beers and bought myself a†ç
†ç
copy of DateStamper.†ç


     With DateStamper I would have been able to see the exact†ç
†ç
creation date of each of these files and simply chosen the most†ç
†ç
recent. This program places an electronic "stamp" on your files†ç
†ç
through which various of several utilities can then read the date†ç
†ç
a file was (a) created, (b) modified, and (c) accessed. The†ç
†ç
amazing revelation for me was that this can be done WITHOUT a†ç
†ç
real time clock.†ç


     In addition to the stamping of date per se, for those†ç
†ç
without a clock there is an additional feature called a "relative†ç
†ç
clock" that marks each file with the value of a counter the†ç
†ç
program maintains. It is an ordinal stamping, marking the "time"†ç
†ç
of file access relative to other files. Each time you access,†ç
†ç
modify, or create a file on your system, from the time you turn†ç
†ç
on your computer or cold boot, DS marks the file with this simple†ç
†ç
number count in the form "+nnnn" representing the "time" this†ç
†ç
file was used relative to other files used during that day. It†ç
†ç
is a rather ingenious way to deal with the absence of a real time†ç
†ç
clock.†ç


     For instance, if you edit JOE.LTR with NewWord and then†ç
†ç
create COMMAND.ZEX with VDE.COM, when you look at your directory†ç
†ç
with the special DateStamper directory program you will see†ç
†ç
something like:†ç

.RR--!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!---------------------R

  >>> Drive C1:   70 files,  using 588k (1336k FREE)     +0181 09 Jun'87
  -- file       size       created          accessed         modified --

C1:COMMAND .ZEX   4k | +0156 09 Jun'87
C1:JOE     .LTR   8k | +0087 06 Jun'87  +0153 09 Jun'87  +0154 09 Jun'87†ç
C1:NW      .COM   8k |                  +0152 09 Jun'87
C1:VDE     .COM   4k |                  +0155 09 Jun'87
.RR--!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!----!--------R

     I have eliminated some unnecessary listings here and changed†ç
†ç
some values to make it easier to understand, but it should be†ç
†ç
clear how this "relative clock" counter works in assigning†ç
†ç
"+nnnn" values. Our first file accessed is NewWord, and that is†ç
†ç
assigned a value of "+0152", meaning it was the 152nd file access†ç
†ç
of the day. Next JOE.LTR was accessed (+0153) and ultimately†ç
†ç
modified (+0154). Then an access to VDE (+0155) to create†ç
†ç
COMMAND.ZEX (+0156). This relative clock counter is a very†ç
†ç
convenient way to keep track of the order of your operations and†ç
†ç
hence is of great assistance in generally keeping control of your†ç
†ç
system and its commands. Z-System users with the command recall†ç
†ç
shell HSH.COM loaded into memory as well are able to combine the†ç
†ç
two to retrace with a rather striking accuracy which command†ç
†ç
accessed which file and in what order relative to other commands.†ç


     All the BBS messages and advertising notices I had been†ç
†ç
reading, however, had given me the erroneous impression that this†ç
†ç
relative clock was the only "stamping" the program did. It was†ç
†ç
only after I purchased it that I realized there [BOLD]is[END†ç
†ç
BOLD] full [UNDERLINE]date[END UNDERLINE] stamping even without a†ç
†ç
real time clock, as shown above. The only thing the user must do†ç
†ç
to generate these dates is enter it manually at computer power-on†ç
†ç
or cold boot. I have found this almost no inconvenience at all†ç
†ç
as I have incorporated it into my Z-System STARTUP alias. CP/M†ç
†ç
users can simply have AUTO.COM boot it up. After that, the date†ç
†ç
is "locked" into memory and can even be displayed on-screen†ç
†ç
independently with a DATE.COM command.†ç


     Of course users with a real time clock can simply choose†ç
†ç
their particular model from the menu provided and will be up and†ç
†ç
running in no time with full stamping of both date and time.†ç


     DateStamper uses approximately 1k of memory for CP/M 2.2 ç
†ç
users and 1.25k for the Z-System version. It is not compatible†ç
†ç
with CP/M 3.0. I am running it on the most memory-hungry Morrow†ç
†ç
Z-System configuration, with 2k additionally taken up by the†ç
†ç
Mini-Winnie hard disk driver -- and Backgrounder II on top of†ç
†ç
this -- and I experience no memory problems. I should emphasize†ç
†ç
that it runs perfectly on a straight CP/M 2.2 system and is not†ç
†ç
in any way, shape, or form a special Z-system utility. It is†ç
†ç
furthermore fully compatible with Smartkey. Not only have I†ç
†ç
experienced no memory problems when running it with our favorite†ç
†ç
key redefinition program, but there appears to be no requirement†ç
†ç
that one necessarily be loaded before the other as is the case†ç
†ç
with many "resident system extensions" of this type.†ç


     I was a little disappointed with the instruction manual, at†ç
†ç
least in regard to its insufficient instructions pertaining to†ç
†ç
installing it on my particular set-up -- with Backgrounder II and†ç
†ç
Z-Systems running as well. I wrote a letter of complaint -- and†ç
†ç
have somehow found myself with the (rather enjoyable) job of†ç
†ç
writing up a Z-System addendum to the next edition of the†ç
†ç
DateStamper instruction manual. Users not needing to perform†ç
†ç
special configurations such as mine did will probably find the†ç
†ç
70-page manual quite comprehensive, and I have appreciated the†ç
†ç
willingness of Plu*Perfect to go out of their way to assist me in†ç
†ç
this regard.†ç


     DateStamper comes with several configuration programs, both†ç
†ç
for its own internal operations and for one's terminal. They are†ç
†ç
quite straightforward and easy to follow, except for Z-System†ç
†ç
users who must get used to following the options for a category†ç
†ç
rather ignominiously dubbed "Unknown BDOS"!  Giving such a name†ç
†ç
to an operating system so many of us have come to know and love†ç
†ç
is disconcerting to say the least. (I have since come to†ç
†ç
understand that the manual and the bulk of the program were†ç
†ç
written before the authors of DateStamper became Z-System†ç
†ç
aficionados.)  Z-System users will choose the file DATSTAMPZ.COM†ç
†ç
whereas those with CP/M 2.2 will choose DATSTAMP.COM.†ç


     One other change I would make in the manual would be to†ç
†ç
instruct users to configure DateStamper with the program DSCONFIG†ç
†ç
as the very first step, before installing DateStamper itself.†ç
†ç
Additionally, when running BGii and Z-System on top of DS, a†ç
†ç
necessary preliminary step should be to run SETUPDS, to situate†ç
†ç
DateStamper precisely at memory location EB80h, 80h bytes above†ç
†ç
where the Z-System IOP would normally load. I very much would†ç
†ç
have liked to have had this information when I first got the†ç
†ç
program; it is non-existent in the manual. Also, since the†ç
†ç
manual was written before the introduction of Backgrounder II,†ç
†ç
there is no mention of the special procedures one must follow in†ç
†ç
this case. Floppy-disk Z-System and CP/M users need make no†ç
†ç
adjustments, and can install DateStamper in its default location,†ç
†ç
below the operating system. In either case, once loaded into its†ç
†ç
proper place I have run it in several different situations with†ç
†ç
no memory problems or incompatibilities.†ç


     After running the configuration options, the program PUTDS†ç
†ç
creates a file !!!TIME&.DAT on each disk on which you desire date†ç
†ç
stamping. This read-only file then contains the actual†ç
†ç
information from which the various utilities read the date.†ç
†ç
After this step, you are ready to go.†ç


     Since CP/M 2.2 users have not made a program of this type --†ç
†ç
taken for granted in the MS-DOS world -- an important part of†ç
†ç
their repertoire, software companies and public domain†ç
†ç
programmers have been somewhat lax in the task of developing†ç
†ç
applications and utilities that support date stamping. To remedy†ç
†ç
this situation, Plu*Perfect provides as part of the package a†ç
†ç
disk of several public domain utilities that have been modified†ç
†ç
by them and others to support date stamping. Most important in†ç
†ç
this regard is SDD.COM, a special version of SD.COM, the standard†ç
†ç
CP/M "Super Directory" program.   It is this program that†ç
†ç
created the above directory listing. Once you begin to use it as†ç
†ç
your everyday directory program, it is most enjoyable and†ç
†ç
interesting to see a listing of dates along with your files.†ç
†ç
Supplied as well are modified versions of Irv Hoff's MCAT and†ç
†ç
XCAT cataloging programs, which become superlative tools as they†ç
†ç
can now read in the date provided by DateStamper.†ç


     Additionally provided on the separate disk is source code in†ç
†ç
assembly language and BDS-C to use as a guide in making†ç
†ç
modifications to already-existing programs to allow them to†ç
†ç
support DateStamper. One assumes as DS's popularity grows we†ç
†ç
will see an increasing number of standard utilities and†ç
†ç
applications modified in this manner.†ç


     For months now I have been using special DS-supporting†ç
†ç
versions of the Z-System utilities VFILER, PPIP (a standard Z-†ç
†ç
System copy program, similar to MCOPY), and PRINT.COM.†ç
†ç
Furthermore, returning the favor, there is a special Z-System†ç
†ç
version of DateStamper's SDD.COM that allows named directories to ç
†ç
be referenced from the command line. Patches to MexPlus and†ç
†ç
dBase II are available as well for CP/M users.†ç


     Perhaps most powerful of all the programs provided in the†ç
†ç
package is DateSweep, DateStamper's superb file management†ç
†ç
utility. DateSweep begins where NewSweep leaves off.  In†ç
†ç
addition to the usual functions provided by a program of this†ç
†ç
type, it allows the user to access and group files by their†ç
†ç
temporal relations. In other words, you can view (or set the†ç
†ç
read-only bit on, or unsqueeze) only those files modified on or†ç
†ç
after, say, August 1, 1987. It also has the very valuable†ç
†ç
"negate selection" feature that sophisticated directory programs†ç
†ç
such as XDIR have. If you would like, for instance, to set the†ç
†ç
SYStem attribute on all files that were modified before August†ç
†ç
31, 1987 and do NOT have the extension of .DOC, DateSweep can†ç
†ç
handle that with ease.†ç


     The most important application of this ability to group†ç
†ç
files by temporal relations, however, provides what I believe to be†ç
†ç
perhaps the most useful application of DateStamper as a whole. It†ç
†ç
gives CP/M 2.2 users the ability to do true "incremental" file†ç
†ç
archiving or backing-up, a feature normally possible only with†ç
†ç
CP/M 3.0 or Z-System. If you are a CP/M 2.2 user who regularly†ç
†ç
backs up important files, you probably have often wished there†ç
†ç
were some way to back up in a single command only those files†ç
†ç
worked on during any given day's session. Backing up one's†ç
†ç
entire disk seems a waste of time, and doing the files one by one†ç
†ç
is no better. C/PM 3.0 and Z-System use the archive bit which†ç
†ç
gets turned off or "reset" when a file is modified. At the end†ç
†ç
of a day an archiving program can be loaded which runs through†ç
†ç
the disk and backs up only those files whose archive bit is†ç
†ç
turned off. Up till now, CP/M 2.2 users have had no way to†ç
†ç
perform this kind of backing up. With DateSweep, however, this†ç
†ç
function is replicated by simply tagging only those files†ç
†ç
modified, for example, during the day's operations, and then†ç
†ç
using DateSweep to copy only these to the backup disk. This†ç
†ç
works very nicely and provides a very valuable feature to CP/M†ç
†ç
2.2 users.†ç


     This capability is taken to its logical and extraordinarily†ç
†ç
useful conclusion with DateSweep's ability to perform full†ç
†ç
operations, including exit from the program itself, by taking†ç
†ç
options and parameters from the command line. Only a very few†ç
†ç
CP/M programs have this degree of sophistication -- NULU is the†ç
†ç
only other that comes to mind. This means, of course, that it†ç
†ç
can be run from a SUBMIT, EX, or ZCPR3 alias script or,†ç
†ç
alternately, straight from the operating system prompt. This is†ç
†ç
very valuable for automating operations. The most important†ç
†ç
application here, of course, and one for which this feature of†ç
†ç
DateSweep is ideally designed, will be to include a DateSweep†ç
†ç
command line in any backing-up submit file you use as the very†ç
†ç
last operation of the day's work. The day can then be entered as†ç
†ç
a parameter on the command line. A file called BACKUP.SUB that†ç
†ç
for instance, will send all files modified on any given day over†ç
†ç
to the C: drive would look like:†ç


                    DATSWEEP $$S`$1``CC:`UNX†ç


Then, from the command line, "SUBMIT BACKUP =082887" will back up†ç
†ç
all files modified on the exact date August 28, 1987.†ç


     Though this will most probably look like gibberish until one†ç
†ç
becomes familiar with DateSweep's commands, it is apparent that†ç
†ç
this feature is extremely useful and in fact most enjoyable to†ç
†ç
watch in operation. You will no doubt find yourself dreaming up†ç
†ç
all sorts of exotic combinations with which to experiment.†ç
†ç
Although since I use Z-System I can do my backing up using the†ç
†ç
archive bit method I find myself often using DateSweep to do so†ç
†ç
because of the pleasure I find in watching the attractive console†ç
†ç
display exhibited during an automation so automated. Power and†ç
†ç
performance like this is very rare in the CP/M world.†ç


     Although the DateStamper directory program SDD.COM does not†ç
†ç
have an option to display only files from a certain date, this†ç
†ç
function as well can be replicated by DateSweep. For instance,†ç


               DATSWEEP $S`=082887``X†ç


typed from the command line (or again, a batch script) will load†ç
†ç
DateSweep, display only those files modified on August 28, 1987,†ç
†ç
and return you to the command line.†ç


     An alternative to either batch control or manual input from†ç
†ç
the command line would of course be to put any of the above†ç
†ç
commands into a SmartKey definition, with a pause where the user†ç
†ç
will insert the date.†ç


     I find this feature of DateSweep extremely useful and an†ç
†ç
absolute pleasure to work with.†ç

†ç
†††††DateSweep also can be configured for an attractive graphics†ç
†ç
display on Morrow and other terminals. When running SETTERM.COM,†ç
†ç
the program that installs all the various DateStamper utilities†ç
†ç
to one's terminal, when prompted for the characters to be used as†ç
†ç
a vertical and horizontal bar, rather than entering the usual†ç
†ç
single characters "|" and "-", respond instead with a multiple†ç
†ç
character sequence. First the two characters that turn graphics†ç
†ç
mode on (for most of us, <ESC>,$), then the character that†ç
†ç
translates into a vertical or horizontal bar when graphics mode†ç
†ç
is on (I believe "I" and "J" respectively for the MDT70), and†ç
†ç
finally "<ESC>,%" to turn graphics mode off. This works to†ç
†ç
produce a very attractive display for this excellent program.†ç

†ç
†††††A program called LOG.COM is also provided with DateStamper†ç
†ç
which records the total amount of time spent on any of several†ç
†ç
user-selected task categories such as "business," "personal,"†ç
†ç
"education," etc. This can be very useful for tax purposes.†ç

†ç
†††††Here's a "teaser" for those considering purchasing the CP/M†ç
†ç
task-switching program Backgrounder II as well and are wondering†ç
†ç
what special features accrue from running both programs†ç
†ç
simultaneously.  At work I use the MS-DOS wordprocessing program†ç
†ç
WordPerfect and have always thought it slick the way one can†ç
†ç
touch a function key and watch the program spit out the current†ç
†ç
date into the document on which I'm working.  It's a very handy†ç
†ç
feature and I had always thought it a shame it couldn't be done in†ç
†ç
CP/M.  Well, now it can.  When Backgrounder, which has very†ç
†ç
extensive key redefinition capabilities, and DateStamper are†ç
†ç
running simultaneously, the character sequence "\,d" (backslash,†ç
†ç
"d") will read the date from DateStamper and insert it in your†ç
†ç
document.  This is very nice and very convenient for letters,†ç
†ç
memos, etc.†ç

†ç

     Now for the final, and in many ways crucial, question for us†ç
†ç
Morrow users: when we will have an inexpensive real time clock?†ç
†ç
Before I realized that DateStamper [UNDERLINE]does[END UNDERLINE]†ç
†ç
provide [UNDERLINE]date[END UNDERLINE] stamping without a clock,†ç
†ç
my intention was to save my pennies until I could afford the $99†ç
†ç
for a Kenmore Z-Time. Now, however, we have two other options.†ç
†ç
My brilliant and industrious fellow columnist Mike Allen is hard†ç
†ç
at work producing a Morrow-compatible clock that appears will be†ç
†ç
available at a much more reasonable price than the Kenmore. I†ç
†ç
will most probably be one of the first to grab one when Mike†ç
†ç
finishes his work.†ç


     On the other hand, in many ways I am quite satisfied with†ç
†ç
DateStamper as is and feel no need for the time stamping a clock†ç
†ç
will provide. My operations are such that accuracy within each†ç
†ç
day is not that terribly important. Different users will have†ç
†ç
different needs in this regard. I am only grateful that we now†ç
†ç
have these options from which to choose.†ç


     Support for this product is excellent. Bridger Mitchell,†ç
†ç
chief technician at Plu*Perfect, has provided me with the most†ç
†ç
generous and knowledgeable assistance. Though the excellent†ç
†ç
telephone support will be convenient for some users, Mr. Mitchell†ç
†ç
has frequently made himself available on the national BBS†ç
†ç
circuit. I much prefer to save myself money with this method†ç
†ç
rather than long-distance voice calls, by using PC-Pursuit, the†ç
†ç
nationwide BBS service ($25 flat fee per month, 800/835-3638 for†ç
†ç
information) through which Mr. Mitchell has graciously answered†ç
†ç
even my most arcane of technical questions on several different†ç
†ç
bulletin boards. Most users, however, will find the manual†ç
†ç
perfectly adequate for dealing with any problems that might†ç
†ç
arise.†ç


     Plu*Perfect Systems may be contacted at P.O. Box 1494,†ç
†ç
Idyllwild, CA 92349 or by phone at 714/659-4432. The price for†ç
†ç
DateStamper has recently been lowered to $45 and at this price is†ç
†ç
a bargain. Plu*Perfect Systems is one of the few companies that†ç
†ç
continues to provide excellent products and continuing support to†ç
†ç
CP/M users. They were the company that developed the TurboRom†ç
†ç
that Kaypro users have found so valuable, along with a host of†ç
†ç
other excellent enhancements. Programmer Bridger Mitchell is one†ç
†ç
of the Echelon (creators of the Morrow Z-System) team working on†ç
†ç
a new operating system to take advantage of the new and powerful†ç
†ç
CP/M-compatible HD64180 and Z280 microprocessors.†ç

†ç

     DateStamper is a product that gives us a capability we have†ç
†ç
long needed, and I would urge all Morrow owners to investigate†ç
†ç
its possibilities.†ç
