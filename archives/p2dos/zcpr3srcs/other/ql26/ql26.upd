QL26 update notes:

Introduced conditionals to create ZCPR3-compatible version which gets  
all its terminal data from the Z3 environment and accepts DU:/DIR:     
specs from the command line.  This option requires assembly to a REL   
file and linkage with VLIB, Z3LIB and SYSLIB.  Most linkers will       
leave a substantial vestigial DSEG at the end of the resulting COM     
file which can be safely deleted with a debugger and the SAVE command. 
The Z1 assembler (or Z80MR) cannot be used if ZCPR3 is equated TRUE.   
Use the "/6" option if using an SLR assembler, "/Z" with M80 (so you   
won't have to concern yourself at all with the ".Z80" directive, as a  
matter of fact, "M80 =QL25.AZM/Z" will work just fine, no renaming!).  
Linkage with L80 or the non-"virtual" SLR linker is tedious and will   
require a two passes, the first to determine the end of the CSEG, the  
second to create the COM file.  DRI's LINK or Echelon's ZLINK are much 
more convenient because they automatically put the DSEG after the      
CSEG.  If ZCPR3 is equated FALSE, the traditional QL assembly methods  
will work as before, resulting in a copy equivalent to version 2.5.

QL25 update notes:

- Corrected a bug which prevented all previous versions from being able to
uncrunch a file if the system's BDOS started at an address other than a
page boundary or a page boundary plus six. This would cause an "unknown
uncrunch error", which wasn't even the "correct" error message due to
another bug in the error message reporting code (also fixed).

- Eliminated the use of alternate registers and the associated EQUate.
Use of the alternate registers (without saving) conflicts with some systems.
This problem reared itself as of v2.4 because earlier versions were distrib-
uted with the alternate register equate set "false", and most people did not
fool with the equate. Now it is foolproof.

- Added Wordstar-like ability to display control characters not otherwise
handled (eg "02" in a file will display as "^B").

-  Other misc. changes; see doc file or source.
--> Many thanks to Ken Reid and Mike Greenhill.

QL24 update notes:

NOTE: Many changes for this version were intended to make QL a  viable
online utility for RCP/M systems, allowing the user the convenience of
finding, skipping, and going backwards thru crunched / libraried files
as  well as previewing non-text files. Most of these features are  not
available on current RCP/M systems.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Note tab expansion was added as of v2.3)

v2.4 Summary of changes:

1.  Checks for existence of BYE. If BYE is present, QL will limit  its
memory usage to 2k below the BDOS base. Previous "CCP overwrite"  ver-
sions  had shown conflicts with some installations of BYE.  Note  that
when  existence of BYE is not detected, the full  memory usage of pre-
vious QL versions is retained.

2.  Furthermore, it is assumed that if BYE is present, the program  is
being operated remotely. It is also assumed to be undesirable to  send
video  attribute sequences to unknown remote terminals. Thus when  BYE
is present, dim, reverse video, and clear screen sequences are  inhib-
ited.

3. Checks WHEEL byte. It is assumed it would be undesirable to allow a
normal (non-wheel) user to do any of the following:

a)  examine  .COM files, eg those on A0: of an RCP/M (for  example,  a
user could dump the contents of a passworded WHEEL.COM program and get
the password, etc.).

b) examine or even acknowledge existance of files w/ SYS attribute set.

c) to do a "core dump" of system memory, which could probably make him
privy  to all sorts of meaty information lurking around.  Note all  of
these  functions are deactivated based on WHEEL, not BYE, so  a  SYSOP
could  remotely  examine his system memory.  Also note that  the  user
WOULD  be  allowed to examine any OBJ or CZM files which  are  on  the
system- these are presumably there for downloading anyway. This  gives
serious RCP/M users a new flexibility.

4. Continuous monitoring and processing for ^S (pause) and the various
abort characters have been added during remote operation.

5.  Annoying unintended aborts have been minimized ( eg. v2.3 aborted
if "+" was hit).  The user must actively type something like X, Q, ^C,
or ^K to abort.

6. Additional "forward" and "backward" synonyms "+" and "-" added  for
EDFILE  compatibility  (also "C" for "R" [repeat find]). "/" for  help
added for ZCPR types.

7. Generalized the code so it can be assembled by any of Z1 (included),
M80 or SLR Z80ASM by changing a single EQU.  A change in the way memory
is allocated at the end prevents generation of a large amount of excess
zeroes at the end of the COM file, regardless of which assembler/linker
is used.

(Other  small  details changed to numerous to mention here.  Some  are
cosmetic.  With apologies to author Nick Dobronovich's  style  prefer-
ence, this release has been "FORM7"'d to upper case source, lower case
comments.  This  was done partly to avoid possible problems  with  the
"Z1" assembler, which insists that the "condition letters" of all  Z80
conditional  instructions  be  capitalized, even if the  rest  of  the
source isn't).
