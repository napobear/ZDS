LOCNDO version 1.1   Revision History

1.0  Initial release

1.1  Scans current directory first. This will speed things up in cases
     where the requested file exists in the current DU.

     Since I don't seem to have retained my basic addition skills from
     school (referring to the errors in the initial release documenta-
     tion pertaining to patch locations)  I've added Patch tags to the
     code. No more patch tables.

     Added drive table so that specific drives may be excluded from the
     search.

1.2  Up to 32 times faster, depending on the number of user areas
     searched. The program now searches the entire drive directory
     at once rather than by individual user areas. No changes to
     operating method.
