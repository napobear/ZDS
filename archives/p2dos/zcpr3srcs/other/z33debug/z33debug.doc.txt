This is the DEBUG.LIB memory utility adapted for use with the Z33RCP library
of routines.

This version includes the hex calculator of MU3.  The resultant RCP is
larger than 2k.  With Z33, it is easy to set up a large RCP.  If you have
not done so, the hex calculator could easily be removed.  Alternatively,
a LOT of room can be saved by using a hard coded CRT protocol rather than
the generalized VLIB routines.  If your terminal doesn't require any fancy
sequences for CLS, EREOL, AT, GOTOXY, STNDOUT, or STNDEND, you can probably
use HARDVID.LIB to replace the equivalent routines in DEBUG.LIB
