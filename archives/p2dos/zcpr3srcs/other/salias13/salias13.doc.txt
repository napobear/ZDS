Update - Version 1.3
    A  bug  appeared in the previous version which  confused  the 
    find/replace routine.

    The  script  is no longer converted to upper case  by  SALIAS 
    since the command processor does that itself.

    The help screen reads the current control key list.  There is 
    no longer a separate non-help screen version for patching.

Update - Version 1.2

1.  Corrects a problem with console input when the program is run
    under the new Z3PLUS system.        

2.  The command key bindings for the editor can now be  installed 
    to  approximate the editor of your preference.   SAINSTAL.COM 
    is a self- documented, screen oriented installation  program.  
    It  does  NOT update the internal help screen of  SALIAS,  so 
    install the version without a help screen.

3.  The  print function sends script to the printer or to a  disk 
    file  with a default name of [alias].TXT.  The disk file  can 
    be  in  one  of  two formats -  one  command  per  line  (for 
    documentation),  or  all commands on a single line  (e.g.  to 
    import into ALIAS.CMD).

4.  If you try to edit a file which is not an alias, SALIAS  will 
    now refuse to cooperate rather than just giving a warning.



GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------

Purpose:
    Create  and  modify alias scripts with  convenience  of  full 
    screen editing.  

Syntax:
    SALIAS [[dir:]aliasname[.COM]] 

    SALIAS  assumes  all files are of type  COM.   The  specified 
    alias  will be loaded for editing, or created if it does  not 
    exist.  If no alias name is given on the command line, it may 
    be supplied on exit.

System Requirements:

    TCAP support for CLS, EREOL, and addressable cursor.  The CRT 
    in  use must have at least 80 columns by 6  lines.   Standout 
    mode must not use space on the screen.

Recursive Aliases:

    SALIAS  uses an internal alias template of the  VALIAS1  type 
    created by Jay Sage.  These aliases may be optionally  Normal 
    or Recursive.  A recursive alias flushes the remainder of the 
    command  line when invoked, giving a clean start  each  time.  
    (Note  that nothing can follow the alias name on the  command 
    line.)   Use  these to loop through a sequence,  such  as  an 
    edit-assemble cycle, until an exit condition is satisfied.


FILE MODE
---------

    The  script  is displayed on screen, and the  following  file 
manipulation functions are available from a menu:

    A   ADD    - Add the script of another alias.

    C   CLEAR  - Clear script.  UNDO recovers.

    E   EDIT   - Enter full screen editor.
 
    F   FORMAT - Reformat the script, one command per line.

    I   INDENT - Format and indent by IF level.

    L   LOAD   - Clear script and load an alias for editing.

    M   MODE   - Select Normal or Recursive mode (toggle).

    N   NAME   - Select a new name (or DIR:) for the script.

    P   PRINT  - Send the script to printer or to a text file.

    S   SAVE   - Format and WRITE the alias to disk.

    U   UNDO   - Cancel unsaved changes to script.















EDIT MODE
---------

    The   script   may  be  edited  like   text.    The   default 
configuration  of  the  editor is  WordStar-like.   Most  of  the 
control  set may be altered to your taste with  the  installation 
program.  

CURSOR:                           INSERTION:                          
           ^R - top of screen         ^V - insert/overwrite     
           ^E - line up             <CR> - insert line
                                      ^N - insert line                 
^S - char     ^     ^D - char     DELETION:                           
           <  $  >                    ^G - delete char at cursor    
^A - word     v     ^F - word        DEL - delete char left            
                                      ^T - delete word right           
           ^X - line down             ^Y - delete line                 
           ^C - first blank line     ^QY - delete to EOLN              
                                  FIND/REPLACE:                       
                                     ^QF - find string                 
^QS, ^QD - SOLN, EOLN                ^QA - find/replace string     
^I (TAB) - Indent line visually.      ^L - repeat find/replace    
    No blanks entered in script.  CONTROL CHAR ENTRY:                 
                                    ^P^n - ^n is ctl char
<ESC> - FILE mode   ^J - Help


File Mode functions are accessible with the ^K trigger:

 ^KX - Save & Quit SALIAS
 ^KD - Save & Clear Editor
 ^KS - Save & Resume on current script
 ^KQ - Quit
 ^KR - Read an alias, or add one to current script
 ^KN - ReName script
 ^KI - Indent by IF level
 ^KU - Undo
 ^KP - Print to list device or disk
 ^KZ - Zap (clear) script  (also ^QZ)



    Alias  script can be entered in upper or lower case.   It  is 
left in the case you chose. 

    TAB  is  intended for visual indentation of IF  levels.   TAB 
looks like 3 blanks, but is not actually added to the script.   A 
command  line may start with a REAL blank in order to invoke  the 
extended command processor.

    Control  character entry uses the ^P trigger.  The  character 
entered is displayed in standout video mode.

            Example:  To enter ^P, use ^P^P (or ^PP)
                      ^P@ (null) is not accepted.

    Commands  longer than the screen width are indicated  with  a 
">"  at  the  apparent end of the line.   The  line  will  scroll 
horizontally when the cursor reaches the screen boundary.
    If  you prefer, ^P+ at the start of a line appends it to  the 
previous  line  without a command separator (";").   This  method 
keeps the entire script visible.

    The  "PRINT"  function  will send the  alias  script  to  the 
printer  or to a disk file (with type .TXT).  The disk  file  can 
use  separate lines for each command (as in the screen  display), 
or create a single command line for importation into a CMD file.

    Find/Replace can be used to replicate a string.

    Example:  <^Q^A> <cr> <IF ~NU > sequence will put string  "IF 
     ~NU" at the cursor.  Every ^L will produce another copy.

    The help screen requires at least a 24 line terminal.  If you 
are working with less than that, the function is aborted.


MESSAGES
--------

Messages which require no response go away when any key is pressed.

    The letter in caps is the default choice.  A <cr> selects it.


CL OVERFLOW n CHARS.  SAVE ANYWAY?:
    The command line is too long by n characters.  If the SAVE is 
not  aborted,  the alias probably won't run.  If  you  have  used 
script parameters such as $U which will require fewer  characters 
when  "expanded",  you  can  choose  to  over-ride  this  helpful 
reminder.


NOT AN ALIAS:
    The  specified alias is not an alias at all, but  some  other 
COM file.  The name is ignored and replaced with a blank.


DESTINATION DISK FULL/ DIRECTORY FULL:
    QUIT or RENAME to a new disk.


ALIAS CHOPPED:
    The  alias file has too many commands to fit on  the  screen.  
(Could happen when using a small screen.)
