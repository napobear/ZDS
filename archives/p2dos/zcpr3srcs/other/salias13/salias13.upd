SALIAS, Version 13
February 3, 1989

Files:
        SALIAS13.COM  - SALIAS, Version 1.3
        SAINS13 .COM  - Installation program for this version only.
        SALIAS13.DOC  - Useful info.


     Sorry for the early appearance of another version of SALIAS.
There was a bug in version 1.2a which caused problems with the find/replace 
routine.  It had to be fixed.

     While doing the fix, I changed the help screen to read the current 
command key set.  Any patches will automatically be reflected.  So now there 
is only one version of SALIAS for distribution

     Why did it become standard practice to upper case the alias script?  It 
looks so much nicer in lower case.  At any rate, SALIAS 13 will leave your 
script in lower case if you enter it that way.

     The installation program will now do the word separator characters.

SALIAS, Version 1.2
October 10, 1988


     Under Z3PLUS, console input was not working properly.  This version 
checks the BDOS version number and selects a console input function 
appropriate for the system.

     The control key set can now be installed to approximate whatever editor 
you prefer.  The installation program is screen oriented and self-documented.
If you intend to do the intallation, use the version of SALIAS without the
built in help screen.
