Introduction

PACK reorganises CP/M disks to improve file access times.  It requires 
ZCPR3 with CP/M 2.2 or ZRDOS, and a Z80 or compatible processor.  It 
will only run if the user has wheel priviledge.

The data on a given disk is rearranged in situ so that all the data 
associated with each file is contiguous.  This reduces disk head 
movement when that file is subsequently read or modified.  The user can 
specify certain files which should not be moved, and can specify 
priorities among the remaining files, so that the most frequently 
accessed files are moved close to the disk directory for reduced access 
time.

Using PACK

Follow these steps -

    1. Make a list of fixed and priority files
    2. Backup the disk
    3. Sort the directory
    4. Run PACK

The file list

PACK requires an input file which specifies which files on the disk must 
remain where they are and which of the remaining files should be moved 
to the beginning of the disk.  The structure of this file is a sequence 
of file names and file classes, one to a line.  File classes (fixed or 
mobile) are specified by a line beginning with a semi-colon.  So a 
typical file list might be:

     ; Fixed
     *:!!*.*
     *:BADSECT*.*

     ; Mobile
     CMD:COMMAND.LBR
     ROOT:*.*

This means that all files in any user area matching !!*.* and BADSECT*.* 
remain fixed (on my system these are PluPerfect DateStamper and 
Backgrounder files, and files which lock out flakey sectors).  Then the 
library file containing less frequently used COM files is moved to the 
front, followed by all files in my ROOT directory.  PACK automatically 
appends *:*.* to the end of the mobile list, so all remaining files on 
the disk follow on.

Case is not significant in the file list, and blank lines are ignored.  
Directories can be given in DU: or DIR: form. * or ? in the directory 
field means all user numbers.  If a disk is specified implicitly or 
explictly it must correspond to the disk specified on the command line
(see D option below).


Backing up the disk

You should do this reqularly, and always before running PACK.  Not that 
a disk crash is more probable while running PACK than at other times, 
but it is more certainly catastrophic if it does happen.  You will 
definitely have to restore the disk from your backup copy (floppies or 
tape) if the system crashes due to a power failure or inadvertent reset 
while PACK is running.


Sorting the directory

Use CLEANDIR or SAP to sort the directory entries on the disk.  The file 
list given to PACK preempts directory order, but within each group of 
files which match an entry in the file list directory order determines 
the order in which the data is packed.


Running PACK

Enter the command:  PACK <flist> <options>

<flist> is required and is the name of the file containing the list of 
fixed and mobile file patterns.  The possible options are:

     Dx      - pack disk x (default is the disk on which flist resides)
     S       - display statistics only.  No packing takes place.
     V       - be verbose.  The file patterns extracted from <flist> are
               displayed, and then the group permutation table (mainly 
               for debugging).

Examples:

     B>PACK FLIST.C DCS       - display number of allocation groups that 
                                would have to be read and written to 
                                pack disk C according to the file list 
                                FLIST.C
     B>PACK FLIST.C DC        - as before, but 'for real'

PACK will ask for confirmation before proceeding to pack the disk.  The 
process takes anywhere from a few seconds to maybe half an hour 
depending on how much data must be moved and how fast your disk hardware 
is.  If you get impatient, on no account switch off or reset the 
machine.  If you hit ^C the program will attempt to cut short the 
packing process, but it may take some time to reach a convenient 
consistent state.

Messages

Normal messages:

     Ready to pack disk x
     Are you sure you wish to proceed? (y/n) - 

     Disk packed

Statistics report:

     nnnn group reads and mmmm group writes required to pack disk.

Interrupt:
     PACK: interrupted by user          - you pressed ^C

Problems with options:

     Option not recognized: x
     No such disk: x
     Disk specification missing

Problems with <flist>

     Line xxxx: invalid filename
     Line xxxx specifies disk x (y expected)
     Line xxxx: can't interpret directory specification
     Line xxxx too long: truncated.

Disk read/write errors:
     Can't read directory               - disk read error
     read error at group gggg:ss        - group cannot be read/written,
     write error at group gggg:ss       -  see PACK.DOC for recovery

General problems:

     PACK requires CP/M 2.2 (or ZRDOS)
     Can't find <flist>
     Disk x is set read only
     Out of memory                      - you have a tiny TPA
     Disk overflow (can't happen!)      - more groups are allocated in 
                                          the directory than there are
                                          groups on the disk
