ZCPR3 -- Rapid Install Program, Version 1.1

Copyright 1986, Paul Pomerleau

  This program installs ZCPR3 programs.  It can install just one, or all in a 
Drive/User, or all the ZCPR3 programs on an entire disk.  It reads in the 
first record of each .COM file it finds, checks to see if it is indeed a 
ZCPR3 command and if it is, installs it.  

  This program is not as powerful as Z3INS is, but it allows you to get more 
done in a hurry.

Syntax:
  Z-RIP [DU: or NDR:][AFN] [*]

  If second filename is an '*', the ENTIRE disk is searched for names which
match the AFN, from maxuser down.

  INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT DESCRIPTORS ARE NOT SUPPORTED.
  TYPE 3 ENVIORNMENTS ARE.
