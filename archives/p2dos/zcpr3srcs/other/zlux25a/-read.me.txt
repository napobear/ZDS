     ZLUX is a ZCPR3 shell for RCP/Ms.  It is designed to imitate
the  functions  of  LUX but does not require the same  amount  of
overhead  to  run.  Rather  than  use  special  LUX*.COM  support
utilities,  it  utilizes  standard utilities  that  are  commonly
available on an RCP/M, namely: TYPEL.COM and SD.COM.
     ZLUX's  menu  of functions include:  BYE,  CAT (display  all
libraries on all drive/user areas),  CHAT, DIR, FILES, HELP, LUX,
SEND,  SENDK  and  TYPE.  It is assumed that  the  file  transfer
program  supports 1K packet transfers and that TYPEL (renamed  to
TYPE) and SD (renamed to DIR) are available on-line.  It is  also
assumed  that ZCPR3's message buffer,  external command line  and
shell  stack  are available.
     Included  in this library are executable copies of ZLUX  for
systems  with either KMD or XMODEM file transfer protocols.  ZLUX
MUST  be installed with Z3INS ,  renamed to LUX.COM and installed
on  drive  A,   user  0  to  run.  The  files,  ZLXXMDMI.OBJ  and
ZLUXKMDI.OBJ, have an internal library directory display function
that  is considerably faster than SDXXX.  Try it,  you might like
it.
     Also,  included in the distribution library is a copy of the
source  code  which  may be modified to  suit  your  tastes.   It
assembles   with   M80  and requires  R.  Conn's  SYSLIB.REL  and
Z3LIB.REL  to  assemble.  You must link in SLUDIR11.REL ahead  of
SYSLIB.REL  if  you  want  to assemble  ZLUX  with  the  internal
directory option.  SLUDIR11.REL has an important fix to the LUDIR
module  in  SYSLIB.  Linking  SLUDIR11.REL ahead of  SYSLIB  will
ensure the correct operation of the internal directory function.
     In releasing this program, I ask that you reserve credit for
its  authorship to me and that,  if you have improvements for the
source code that may be of interest to others,  you apprise me of
them.   Please   read   the  accompanying  UPDATE.NTE  file   for
information on ZLUX revisions.
     A  number of persons helped me both directly and  indirectly
with  ZLUX.   Thanks to Al Hawley (Znode,  Ladera Heights,  Ca.),
Harris Edelman (PVAC Venice, Ca.), Kim Levitt and Jay Sage, Bruce
Morgen and Mark Motley.  I especially appreciate the work done by
Bruce   Morgen  in V2.1 and his 2.2,  which  broke  the ground on
improving ZLUX's shell behaviour.
     I  commend  Ron Fowler for his PROLINK (and  for  making  it
available  to  the  public),  which  I used  extensively  in  the
development of this program.  R. Conn's SYSLIB and Z3LIB are also
a joy to use.
