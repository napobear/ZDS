Version 2.5 12/4/86
     Fixed  a  bug in the inline routine that has been  plagueing
ZLUX since V2.2.   The original inline routine expanded tabs with
spaces  but  placed a single tab character in  the  line  buffer.
Attempts to backspace after a tab would hang the system.
     NEW  with  2.5 is an optional internal  directory  function.
Although  an  internal  directory runs slightly  counter  to  the
original intention of ZLUX,  i.e. to make maximum use of external
utilities,  the  internal directory is a great deal faster  than,
say,  SDXX, and therefore, warranted. Purists can of course stick
to  the  original  and used an external program  for  display  of
library  directories.  Importantly,  Bruce  Morgen's fix  to  the
SYSLIB  SLUDIR  module,  SLUDIR11.Z80 was/is used for  assembling
ZLUX25 w/the internal directory option.
     Joubert  Berger  contributed an improvement  to  the  CTRL-E
function; Harris Edelman helped again w/beta testing; thanks also
to Norman Beeler, Al Hawley, Steve Kitahata and Bruce Morgen.

 Ver 24   5/27/86
     Incorporated .ARC file capability into ZLUX, using UNARC utility
 for DIR and TYPE commands.  Fully automatic determination of LBR/ARC
 file presence.  No syntax differences in the commands.  No KMD/XMODEM
 ARC file transfer at present time (although its being worked).
 Shortened and re-worded internal ascii statements to keep pgm
 less than 4k...
     This is an "OFFICIAL" release, with approval of J. Poplett.

Multi-user/RASVersion 2.3  4/26/86
     Integrated  features  from  my  unreleased  2.2  with  Bruce
Morgen's.  Most importantly,  ZLUX V2.3 makes sure that the  FILE
command  and  the  LUX  command use the drive/user  area  of  the
attached library file as the default.  Thus,  when a user invokes
the program from a DU different from the DU of the library  file,
the  FILES  command will give the correct directory and  the  LUX
command will default to the correct DU.
     A  control-R  function which emulates the BDOS line  editing
function has been added to the command line editor so that  users
can display the command buffer.  Particularly useful in the event
of line noise. (Thanks to Harris Edelman for the suggestion).
     The line editor also now recognizes a semicolon as a comment
delimiter a la CP/M and ZCPR3.  To complement this function,  the
line editor was altered so that it wouldn't delete an entire line
when a user typed passed the buffer.  It was an hyperbolic way to
handle  the condition in any case.  The size of the command  line
buffer has been enlarged.
     There  are now conditional assembly equates that allow  ZLUX
to pass unrecognized commands to the CCP and that has ZLUX use an
external help menu instead of its internal one.  Please note that
this  option  does  not use the ZCPR3  HELP  utility  on  purpose
because TYPE will return the user to the ZLUX command line.  HELP
does not. The file ZLUX.HLP is however compatible with HELP.

--------------
V2.2 03/31/86
     Translated  ZLUX  to Z80 (Zilog) mnemonics for the  sake  of
Bruce  Morgen's  sanity.  Optimized  sections  of  code  to  take
advantage  of the new instruction set.  Many sections  have  been
whittled down.  Following Bruce's lead, internal subroutines were
replaced  by  SYSLIB and Z3LIB equivalents wherever possible  AND
desireable.
     Added   BDOS   line   editing  capability   (control   R,U,X
processing)  and  line  length limiter  to  ZLUX's  command  line
editor.   Also,  added  recognition of the semicolon as a comment
delimiter (Al Hawley's suggestion).
     Added  recognition of two-digit user areas by re-working the
PARSE sub-routine.  Thanks to Bruce Morgen for suggesting the use
of Z3LIB and SYSLIB as an approach to this problem.
     Added   assembly   time  conditional  option   that   allows
non-ZLUX commands to be passed to ZCPR3 for processing (suggested
by Jay Sage).

-------------------
Version 2.2:
Where do I begin?  OK here goes:
Has full ZCPR3 environment obedience, including acceptance of DU:
form, maximum drive and user, etc.  Most of John's code, including
the line editor and command scanner, replaced by tighter (no offense,
John), more complete adaptations from the LIBs and from ZCPR3 itself
(a great school for fledgling kode krunchers!).  Program is now a
bit larger (due mostly to 10-15% LIB overhead, including our very
own true-Z3 parser, very handy...), but seems to be as fast or faster.
Zilog mnemonics now, with John's OK.  I figure there's another record
or so to be saved by optimizing the code, just putting it off until
featuritis threatens the 4k boundary.   New features include support
for traditional XMODEM and KMD file sending syntax, a new PWD command
(a must for getting around on systems that don't accept DU: form), one-
keystroke (?) help command, protected line editor buffer, unsupported
control characters don't get to the command line, etc., etc.

---------------------
Version 2.1:
     Eliminated unnecessary and dangerous play with  user-defined
bytes in Z3 message buffer - Z-Msg/METAL and some versions of the
ZCPR3  CCP use these bytes for security-related functions.   ZLUX
no  longer  has  to  be  the only  shell  on  the  stack  either.
Reformatted to standard Z3 tool source file (use M80 or  modified
RMAC)  and  deleted  transcribed Z3LIB routines from  this  file.
Code still is not optimized because I can't abide Intel mnenonics
long  enough to do that and I believe that the original  author's
preference should be honored - Bruce Morgen, 3/24/86
