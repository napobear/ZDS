***** SCREEN ORIENTED ERROR HANDLER FOR ZCPR33 *****
This version fixes a bug which caused the screen to be cleared
any time the program was invoked. I also now make Z33VERR look
at the quiet flag before printing it's install message. There
is also a new command line parameter 'S' which will inhibit
the initial screen clear when an error is detected. Also added
alias <CR> for 'E'dit, <ESC> for 'A'bort, & <SP> for 'C'ontinue
