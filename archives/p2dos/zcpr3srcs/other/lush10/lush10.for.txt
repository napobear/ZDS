LUSH (Library Utility SHell) is a minimal ZCPR shell which takes 
advantage of the extended CCP services of ZCPR 3.3 and requires NO 
installation.  Since ZCPR itself parses all directory 
specifications, LUSH automatically adjusts to current security 
levels.  LUSH eliminates the need to install specific library 
program names by parsing the current library name into any command.
