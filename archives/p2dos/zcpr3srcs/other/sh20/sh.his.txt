Version: 2.0
Date: 5/1/87

Modifications:
1) Fixed a couple of defects introduced in v. 1.1.
2) Removed the internal commands "shcmt", "shecho", and "shexit".
   Exiting is now accomplished by striking ^X at the beginning of an empty
   line.
3) Added several new commands to the line editor.
4) Added a 20-line history, using up- and down-arrow keys (as defined in 
   the TCAP) to move backward and forward.  The history list is kept in
   the file SH.HST in the "ROOT" directory or at the bottom of the 
   path if the "ROOT" directory doesn't exist.
5) Added a field for an alternative load address, for use under ZCPR3.3.
6) Added brief help invoked by "SH //".
7) Compacted and speeded up code throughout.
