;  File Type Skip Table

;  While building the list of files to back up from the selected disks,
;  BUSH will delete files with file types matching those in the list below.
;  This allows you to avoid cluttering up your backup disks with BAK, PRN,
;  HEX, and other similar intermediate-type files that can easily be
;  recreated from the matching source file, and with temporary-type files
;  that might be left over from some interrupted process.  If you keep
;  archive copies of particular file types (LBR/ARC files) on separate
;  disks from your main system backup files, you can also specify those
;  here to avoid having duplicate backup copies of these (typically large)
;  files.  Up to SKPMAX file types may be selected to be skipped.

;  Maximum Backup Disk Wasted Space

;  Since BUSH can break up files into fragments, it can utilize disk space
;  more efficiently than previous backup utilities.  If the next file in
;  the list of files to back up is larger than the free space remaining,
;  BUSH will see if the amount of space remaining is larger than the
;  value of WASTE below.  If so, it will break up that file into fragments,
;  and write the first fragment into the remaining space on the current
;  backup disk.  If the remaining space is less than WASTE Kbytes, BUSH
;  will go on to the next backup disk.  This allows you to avoid the
;  situation of having 150K left empty on a backup disk because the next
;  file in the list happens to be 152K long.

;  File Type Compression Table

;  BUSH has the ability to recognize that certain file types are probably
;  large files that should be compressed prior to backing them up.  Such
;  files include assembler source files (MAC, Z80, and ASM types), source
;  files for compilers/interpreters (BAS, PAS, etc.), and database files
;  (DBF, NDX, and related file types).  Upon finding files of this type
;  in the list of files to be backed up, BUSH will build a separate list
;  of files to be crunched, and call CRUNCH.COM to compress the files. 
;  IT WILL THEN ERASE THE UNCOMPRESSED SOURCE FILE.
;  After all files in the list of files to back up have been checked and
;  compressed if required, BUSH will rebuild the file list before
;  beginning the backup process.
