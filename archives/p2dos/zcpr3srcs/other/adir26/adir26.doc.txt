ADIR v2.2   26/01/89
====================
  ADIR  provides  a  sorted list in a  directory  format  of  all 
Aliases  contained  in  the ALIAS.CMD  file.  ADIR is designed to
search for ALIAS.CMD in  the  ROOT directory,  the  last  element
along the search path.  Alternatively, the program may be config-
ured to search a default directory. If the wheel byte is set, the
directory to search in the  form DU: or  DIR:,  may be entered on
the command line. 

Program Usage:
               ADIR [DIR:][filename.ext] [=mask] [/ooo]

  All tokens are optional. Any invalid or restricted token is ig- 
nored.

  When  ALIAS.CMD, or the selected file is located in a  password 
protected directory, either by path search or by user  selection, 
the  Wheel byte is checked and if not set, the user is  requested 
for  the  directory  password. An invalid  entry  terminates  the 
program. 

  ADIR supports the following command line switches.

  P  -  Output is directed to the LST: device as well as  to  the 
        console.  Wheel  must  be  on  for  this  switch  to   be 
        recognised.

  S  -  Hidden aliases are displayed as well. The term  "hidden" 
        is explained below. Wheel must be on.

  N  -  Output is not paged. No [more] prompts  appear  when  the 
        screen fills. ADIR is configured for an 80 x 24 terminal. 
        See the patch table at the end of this file for configur-
        ation information.

  Ln -  Where 'n' is numeric. Specify Alias Name length.  Used to  
        display alias names which are longer than the default.
        See NOTE 3 below.

  Rn -  Loads ZCPR register  'n'  with the number of matching en-
        tries. n may be register 1 through 9.

  mask: Takes the form '=MASK' and may be up to twenty characters
        in length.  The first n characters of each entry are com-
        pared to the mask and the entry eliminated  from the dis-
        play if no match occurs.

  ALIAS.CMD file conventions
  ==========================

ADIR assumes that the ALIAS.CMD file adheres to a few simple rules:

 1.  ADIR  ignores any  line beginning  with a space or semi-colon.
Aliases beginning  with either a colon or an  underline  character
are special cases.  The leading character  is normally ignored and
the alias is displayed as though the character did not exist.

              Thus the line:
                             :default Z3ERROR
              is ignored, while
                             :DEFAULT Z3ERROR
              would be displayed as:  
                              DEFAULT

If  the  /S  switch were used in the  above  example,  then  both 
aliases  would  be  displayed as  found,  including  the  leading 
colons.
 
 2. ADIR  assumes  that any  alias beginning with  a  lower  case 
letter  (a-z) is "system" or hidden. These are not displayed  nor 
included in the final tally (see switch /S). Thus the lines:

             PACK ROOT:;PUBLIC /CA;PACK2;PUBLIC /DAU8;%D0%U0:
             pACK2 LX SAP;LX PACK10

produce only one entry, "PACK" in the directory. The rest of  the 
alias name may be in either upper or lower case,  although if the
CAPSON  flag is left off and  hidden aliases appear in  ALIAS.CMD
in lower case characters,  they become easily  distinguishable in
the directory when the /S switch is used.
Hidden aliases may also occcur in either upper or lower case,  or
in numeric or  other form following  a special comment line which
takes the form:
               ;PRIVATE

The word PRIVATE  must occur in upper case.  No entries following
this line are  displayed unless the  /S  switch is present on the
command line.

 3. "Equated" aliases are treated as separate entries.
       
    ie.  SD=?DIR=D=dIR/? produces two entries: SD and D,  while
         ?DIR and dIR/? are ignored as explained above.
 
4.  Finally, ADIR assumes by default that the maximum length  of 
an  alias  name will be nine characters.  This may be altered by
changing the value of ALENTH as explained below. Any alias  name
which exceeds the vaule of ALENTH is truncated and appended with
a semi-colon to indicate that it has been truncated. 


  ERROR Messages
  ==============

  du:ALIAS.CMD not found
     - ADIR was unable to locate the file ALIAS.CMD in either the
       root directory by default,  or in the  specified directory
       by user selection.

  File too large. ABORTING
     - ALIAS.CMD contains more alias names than can be accomodated
       in the available TPA.

  Can't Sort. File too large
     - ADIR ran out of buffer space while attempting to sort the 
       list.



  PATCH TABLE - configure to suit
  ===========
Configuration flags are located  near the  beginning of the code
and are easily identified as shown in the label column below.

LABEL     Function    Default   Comments
 ---------------------------------------
CAPSON>  Capitalize      0      Note 1
TLINE>   Chars/Line   50H/80    Note 2,3
PLINE>   Lines/Page   16H/24    Note 2
ALENTH>  Default Len. 0AH/10    Note 3        
TRNCHR>  Truncation   ';'       Note 4
         Character
DEFDU>   Default DU   01/00     Note 5

NOTE 1
 Capitalization Flag. Default is OFF to display Aliases as found. 
If  set  TRUE  (0FFH), all aliases, including hidden  if  the  /S 
switch is used, are displayed in Upper Case.

NOTE 2
 Values for terminal width and page length from the TCAP are nor-
mally used.  In the absence of a TCAP,  TLINE and PLINE determine
the display format.
 Congigure to suit your hardware, or preference (See Note 3).

NOTE 3
 Set ALENTH to the maximum number of characters in an alias name. 
The number  of aliases printed on a line is  a function of ALENTH
and TLINE. With the default settings the display is eight columes 
wide.  The  formula for the number of columes is the  integer  of 
TLINE  divided  by  ALENTH. Thus if you want  a  display  of  six 
columes  on  an eighty character terminal, set TLINE to  50H  and 
ALENTH  to 0DH. The display would then be left justified with  13 
characters allotted to each entry. 
  It should be  remembered that  the larger  the value of  ALENTH, 
the fewer actual records ADIR will be able to  handle.  This will
not be  a problem in most  cases as ADIR will use as much  of the
available  memory as  it requires for  the data table.   With the 
default setting ALENTH=10, over 4400 Aliases could be accomodated.

NOTE 4
 This is the  truncation indicator.  The semi-colon was chosen as
it is the single character  which is least  likely to appear in a
command name,  being the command separator character on most sys-
tems. 

NOTE 5
 DEFDU  provides an alternate  method of determining  the default
directory for non-wheel users. If the first byte is set to FF hex
then the normal ROOT search method is used. Otherwise, and as the
default,  the default DU may be specified.  Byte 1 represents the
drive, where A=1; and Byte 2 the user area, 0-31. The ROOT search
method is always used if the  wheel  byte is set and may be over-
ridden from the command line.


   FINAL NOTES
   ===========
 I have found ADIR useful for other applications as well. For ex-
ample: I keep a list of files with descriptions contained on arc-
hived disks. The records of the file take the form:

FILENAME.EXT  [TYPE]  Description.

 Using an alias:
OFFLINE  ADIR BLAKBORD.FOR /L15 
 I am able to quickly obtain a directory  of all files I have on
backup disks.  The same type of file and alias  helps me quickly
determine whether  a particular file  may be obtained from other
boards by searching captured directory listings.

I'd like to hear of other applications.  I may be reached at the
