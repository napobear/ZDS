ADIR - ALIAS.CMD Directory     Update History

V1.0   Jan 15/88 Original program written in Modula II

 1.1 - 1.4       Various Revisions.

 1.5   Jan 08/89 
       Final Modula Version. Introduced Sort.

 2.0   Jan 15/89 
       Initial Z80 Machine Coded version using Syslib.

 2.1   Jan 22/89 
       Test for TAB as well as Space for delimiter character.
       Allow DIR: specification as well as DU: 

2.2    Accept filename from command line if wheel set
       Special treatment for characters such as   : _ >. See
       the current documentation. 
       Check for protected directories.
       Patch table for customization. See Doc.
       Optional printer output and display of hidden Aliases if Wheel on
       Optional non paged output

 2.3   Removed code which prevented any alias beginning with a punctuation
       character being displayed in the non-hidden format. This code also
       had the side effect of hiding aliases beginning whih numeric char-
       acters. The present version recognizes any character with the ex-
       ception of ":" and "_" in the first character position.

       Fixed the bug which caused ADIR to hang up if the ALIAS.CMD file
       happened to end with a blank line; CR or LF as the last character
       in the file.     
 
 2.4   This version represents no major modifications. Recursion was a 
       problem in 2.3 if any of the options were used in previous runs.
       All flags are now reset each time the program is re-entered.

 2.5   Added "truncation" of alias names which are longer than ALENTH.
       Long aliases are presented terminated with a semi-colon. The
       truncation character is patchable at the label TRNCHR.
       Added test for commented lines (beginning in ";").
       Added /Ln switch for length specification from the command line.
 
 2.6   Terminal data is now taken from the TCAP if available. If no
       TCAP is installed, the values at TLINE and PLINE are used.
       In addition to "lower case" hidden aliases, any alias present
       after the comment line ";PRIVATE" is treated as hidden.
       Alias count may be directed to one of the ZCPR registers (1-9)
       Accepts search mask from command line.
       Optional default DU to find ALIAS.CMD if non-wheel.  
       Accepts filename from command line regardless of wheel state.
       - Internal Environment no longer supported.
