; Extended Termcap Data for NZ

; This is the proposed TermCap Data for the New Z-System.
; It more fully describes the terminal and its capabilities.
; It remains compatible with VLIB but offers added features.
; This particular TCAP is used by the ON! computer.

ESC	EQU	27		; ASCII escape character

NZTCAP:	DB	'WYSE-60        ' ; Name of terminal (15 bytes)
;
; It is often desirable to differentiate terminals with other than
; their commands.  For example TeleVideo 955 has the same command
; set as Wyse 60 but takes less time to initialize (reset).
; Also, it might be interesting to know whether this is an ASCII
; or an ANSI terminal.  The Terminal Type byte is implemented for
; this purpose.  Current usage allows 8 ASCII terminal types and
; 8 ANSI types as follows:
;
;	Type 0	TeleVideo 925/950
;	Type 1	TeleVideo 955		Requires 2 seconds for reset
;	Type 2	Wyse 60			Requires 9 seconds for reset
;	Type 3	..Unassigned
;	...
;
;	Type 16	DEC VT-100
;	Type 17	DEC VT-220
;	...

;
; The ON! bios implements a filter or TRAP in the CONOUT routine to prevent
; undesirable codes from reaching the terminal.  The ESC character is trapped
; and not sent immediately.  The bios then looks at the following character
; and compares it to those in the following table.  If a match is found,
; both the ESC and the following character are sent to the terminal.  Other-
; wise the ESC is not sent.  This will prevent the terminal from being
; 're-programmed' by modem noise or by 'typing' a .COM file.
;
; The TRAP itself is programmable:
;
;	ESC ESC 0	Will turn the trap OFF
;	ESC ESC 1	Will turn the trap ON
;
; Also, if the first character of the following string is 00h, TRAP is OFF.
;
; Second character of valid escape sequences with trap ON (15 max)

; Similar to the ESC trap, when the bios receives a control code it will
; check for it in this table and trap it if there is no match.
