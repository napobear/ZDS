REVISION HISTORY
----------------
Version 1.0h (October 8, 1987)
 Bug fixed:
  - The ^KR command failed to relog the original user number after a file is
  - read in.  The result was that if a file was appended from another user
  - area, the alias was written to that area on exit.  Added two calls noted
  - with "[H]" in the comments.  (Bruce Morgen for ZSIG release version as per
  - Rob Friefeld's note of October 4, 1987 on Ladera Z-Node #3)

Version 1.0g (5 Sept 87)
 Bugs fixed:
  - On rereading an alias with a '+' char (e.g. SLRNK+), SALIAS stripped it out.
  - Lower case chars could be lost at the end of a long alias

 Changes:
  - On saving an updated alias file, the "Replace (Y/n)?" default is now YES.
    You can just hit <CR> instead of answering this question.

  - In FILE mode, when loading a new file, you stay in FILE mode rather than
    jumping into the editor.  Go to edit with 'E' or <ESC>.

  - A message is printed if an alias won't fit on the screen.  Previously,
    the alias would be chopped without warning.  This could occur after
    switching to a smaller screen or when reading an alias created with another
    program (the alias would need over 20 commands with the last ones quite
    long).

  - A few improvements in the code which, of course, introduce no new bugs.

Version 1.0f (24 Aug 87)
 Bug fixed:
  The alias did not expand the $* command line parameter properly.  The alias
  code was changed to skip the leading blank on the command tail.

Version 1.0e (4 Jun 87)
 Bugs fixed:
- Looooong commands now supported.  These were truncated to the screen width
  previously.
  To append a line to the previous one without a ';' break, head it with
  trigger ^P+.  SALIAS will do this automatically as it reads in a file with
  such commands.  I think this scheme is easier to work with than horizontal
  scrolling since everything stays visible.  (At any rate, it avoids a massive
  rewrite of the editor.)
 - "Tabs" handled individually for ^S,^D and DEL.  However, ^G and ^T will
   delete all tabs to the right.
 - Blank lines are not indented (confused ^C command).
 Changes:
 - Added a new buffer - CLBUF - where command line is edited.  This buffer is
   moved to the alias on a disk save.  Previously, the command line was built
   directly inside the alias.  These functional changes result:
 	1) UNDO recovers script from the alias, which is unchanged since the
		last disk write or load operation. (Unaffected by formatting.)
	2) FORMAT only formats the script being edited.
	3) INDENT (^KI) formats and indents IF levels.
	4) Only disk write operations choke on a command line overflow.  Other
		functions (format, read) are less finicky.  You can work with
		oversize script until you try to save it.
- Linked with a DSEG at 2500h (uninitialized data).  Permitted above changes
  without increased file size.
- Stack brought into DSEG instead of top of TPA.  This with a view toward
  ZCPR33 trick of keeping multiple programs in memory.  (I assume a self-
  contained program would be better behaved.)
- Command line check more rigorous.  Only '?...', '/ ', or '//' get help info.
  Thus a file or directory name could start with the '/' char.
 
Bug fixes and changes in previous versions disappear into history.
