PURPOSE:
	Create and modify alias files with convenience of full screen editing.

SYNTAX:
	SALIAS [ [du: or dir:]aliasname ]
	Everything in [] is optional.  SALIAS always assumes all files are
	type COM.  If the file does not exist or is not an alias, a new alias
	will be created with the specified "aliasname".

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
	TCAP support for CLS, EREOL, and addressable cursor.  The CRT in use
	must have at least 80 columns by 6 lines.  Standout mode must not use
	space on the screen.  WHEEL status is required.

RECURSIVE ALIASES:
	SALIAS uses an internal alias template of the VALIAS1 type created by
	Jay Sage.  These aliases may be optionally Normal or Recursive.
	A recursive alias flushes the remainder of the command line when 
	invoked, giving a clean start each time.  (Note that nothing can follow
	the alias name on the command line.)  Use these to loop through a
	sequence, such as an edit-assemble cycle, until an exit condition is
	satisfied.

     				    FILE MODE
 				  ---------
    C	CLEAR  - Clear editor.  The alias is not changed.  (UNDO recovers)

    E	EDIT   - Enter edit mode.

    I	INDENT - Format and redisplay with indentation of IF levels.

    L	LOAD   - Load a file for editing.  The user is prompted for an
		 unambiguous file name (.COM type is assumed).

    M	MODE   - Select Normal or Recursive mode (toggle).

    R	RENAME - Select a new name (or just DU:) for the current edit.

    P	PRINT  - Send the alias script to the list device.

    S	SAVE   - Format and WRITE the alias to disk.

    U	UNDO   - Reload edit buffer from memory image of alias.

Sample Screen:

SALIAS 1.0       Mode: Normal        Free: 148         Alias Name: A15:START
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ROOT:
LDR SYS.ENV,SYS.RCP,SYS.FCP,SYS.NDR
PATH TOP ROOT




------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<ESC> - FILE MENU                 -- EDITING --                      INSERT ON

Editing the alias START.COM with commands displayed one per line.  This is a
normal rather than recursive alias.  There is room for another 148 characters
in the command line buffer.  (The character count includes the ";" command
separators although they are not shown.)  The editor is in "insert" rather
than "overwrite" mode.  Pressing <ESC> key will show the single letter
command options described for "File Mode".  (Another <ESC> returns to "Edit
Mode" and repaints the screen.)

Notes:

1. Alias script can be entered in upper or lower case.  Formatting upcases it.

2. TAB is intended for visual formatting, e.g. to indent IF levels.  There
   are no tab stops.  Note that tabs are not counted in the "Free" display.
   FORMAT strips tabs out.  Commands may start with real blanks.

3. Control character entry uses the ^P trigger.  Lower case letters can also
   be deliberately entered this way.  The character entered is displayed in
   standout video mode.

   Example:  To enter ^P, use ^P^P (or ^PP).  To enter "a", ^Pa.
   ^P@ (null) is not accepted because it is used as a string terminator.

4. Find/Replace can be used to replicate a string.

   Example: < ^Q^A, <cr>, IF ~NU > sequence will put string "IF ~NU" at the
   cursor.  Every ^L will produce another copy.

5. ^J gets a help screen if running the help version of SALIAS.  Otherwise, it
   is used as a convenient toggle to end-of-line/start-of-line.

6. ^P+ at the start of a line appends it to the previous line without a command
   separator (";").  Use this to build long single commands.  When SALIAS
   reads a file with long commands, it automatically formats them this way.

   Example:  MCOPY WORK:=FILE1,FILE2,FILE3,FILE4
	     +,FILE5,FILE6
   would load as:
	     MCOPY WORK:=FILE1,FILE2,FILE3,FILE4,FILE5,FILE6

				    MESSAGES
				  --------
Messages which require no response will remain until any key is pressed.

CL OVERFLOW n CHARS:
	The command line is too long by n characters.  SAVE aborted.

NOT AN ALIAS:
	The specified file is not an alias at all.  If the file is the one
being edited, a SAVE will destory the original file.

DESTINATION DISK FULL/ DIRECTORY FULL:
	Unable to SAVE alias on full disk.  QUIT or RENAME to a new disk.

... xxxx? (Y/n):  or ... xxxx? (y/N):
	The letter in caps is the default choice.  Any response other than
the alternate choice will do xxxx.

ALIAS CHOPPED:
	The alias file has too many commands to fit on the screen.  Could
happen when using a smaller screen or with an alias created with another
program.

				  MISC NOTES
				----------  
1)  Examples of syntax:

SALIAS -> Program comes up with blank alias.  On SAVE, a filename is demanded.
SALIAS ROOT:START -> Edit the START.COM alias in the ROOT: directory.
SALIAS A* -> On command line only, can load ambiguous file with leading letter.

2)  The display format is one command per line.  When there are no more lines,
the last line is filled.  If there are still more commands, they will be lost.

3)  The following sequence will "clone" SALIAS with new default modes.
(It is distributed in insert mode, normal alias.)

>SALIAS		; call it up
  ^V		; toggle insert
  ESC		; exit edit mode
  M		; toggle mode
  X		; exit SALIAS
>SAVE 28 SALIAS10.COM	; keep the change ... OR
>SAVE 32 SA10-HLP.COM	; help screen version
