   FINRP28Z.COM is the newest version of Eric Gans' FINREP (find/replace) 
utility.  I have overlaid it with the ZCPR3 adaptation patch, FNREPZPT.Z80,
which Bruce Morgen distributed back in March '87 for FINREP24.COM.  As far
as I can tell all that was needed was a change in the location of the patch 
code (OBB0h vice 0C44h).  Renamed to FINREP.COM and placed on A0:, this 
highly useful utility now responds correctly to ZCPR3 "DU:" and named 
directory references and can be used from any place on one's system.  See
FINREP28.LBR (probably now on many BBSs) for documentation on usage.
