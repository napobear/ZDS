How to install ZCPR3 on Kaypro hard disk With ADVENT TURBO ROM.

     Install the Turbo System on your computer per Advent's
instructions, after you have a runable system create a 58K system
with MOVTURBO ie:

     MOVTURBO 58.00

     You will have a file called TURB5800.SYS.  You will need
DDT.COM, TURB5800.SYS, ZINIT-A.HEX, ZCPR3-A.HEX, EX.COM, and
ZTUR-A.SUB on the same disk for the following.

     Type as follows: EX ZTUR-A

Then use turbogen as follows: TURBOGEN ZTUR5800.SYS

     Install on your floppy drive first to test and see if it works. You
should have LDR.COM SYS.ENV, SYS.RCP, SYS.FCP, and START.COM already on
your floppy, if you have followed directions when you boot from floppy
it should load all SYS and give the A prompt.  If it works O.K. you can
then use turbogen to install on your hard drive.

     The source is supplied for Z3BASE.LIB, Z3HDR.LIB, ZINIT.ASM,
SYSENFV.LIB, SYSRCP.LIB, and SYSFCP.LIB, all can be changed and
reassembled with MAC.  You will need ZCPR3.ASM, SYSENV.ASM,
SYSRCP.ASM, and SYSFCP.ASM if you want to change any of the
specifications.

     START.COM is a alias that is set to work with the supplied ENV.
You will need to install any of the ZCPR3 utilities to work with the
ENV.

     This is a FULL ZCPR3 except for the IOP.SYS
