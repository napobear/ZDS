     Ok for all you people that have the Turbo Rom on a 2 or 4 this is a
bare bones ZCPR3.

What you get is as follows:

1: Change DU: with one command, (no user command)
2: Path to A0:  ie: any program in A0: can be called from anywhere on the
   system
3: Multiple command  ie: B:;Dir  will change to B drive and give the directory
4: Resident DIR, ERA, REN, and SAVE.  You will need a transit TYPE and LIST.
5: 62.75k CP/M system.  (Only .25 smaller than maximum with Turbo Rom.)
   A: to P: drives   (for you ram disks guys)

What you don't have is, you do not need any other files on the disk to boot
the system.  Everything is on the system tracks.

                            Installation

     I have simplified the installation with the use of EX and a sub
file.

     First thing is to install turbo rom per advent instructions, then
MOVTURBO 62.75 to create a TURB6275.SYS.

     Put all of these on one disk.

1: Turb6275.sys
2: Ex.com
3: Ztur-b.sub
4: DDT.com
5: ZINIT-B.HEX
6: ZCPR3-B.HEX

Type as follows:    EX ZTUR-B

     After EX has finished you will have a new ZTUR6275.SYS use TURBOGEN
to install to a disk, boot up and say, GOLLY it works.

     For the few that want to run a bare bones ZCPR3 on a Hard Disk make
a 61.25 system and use ZTUR-C.SUB, ZINIT-C.HEX, and ZCPR3-C.HEX.

                                 As Always,
                                 Your Friend
