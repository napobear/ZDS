  VERROR is a ZCPR3 error handler.  Just execute it without any
parameters and it will install itself.  When ZCPR3 gets a command
that it cannot process, it will give control to VERROR.  VERROR
will then ask you if you wish to edit the offending command.
Should you say anything but (Y)es, the line will be thrown out.
If you do say (Y)es, you will be put into an editor which uses a
subset of the WordStar command set.

  These commands are:

^E : Line Up
^X : Line Down
^S : Character Left
^D : Character Right
^A : Word Left
^F : Word Right
^G : Delete Character
^T : Delete Word
^Y : Delete Command Line and Return to System
^V : Flip Mode from Insert to OverWrite and Back
^P : Insert Control Character (or Lower-Case Character)

  In addition to the WordStar commands, these are available:

^K : Line Up
^J : Line Down
^H : Character Left
^L : Character Right
^C : Command Right (moves to next semicolon)
^R : Remove Command (deletes from cursor to semicolon)
^U : Undo Last ^T or ^R -- (useful for copying text)
<CR> : Save Command Line and Return to System
<DEL> : Delete Character to Left

Please note:
  VERROR looks for itself in the base of the path (ROOT:).  Don't
change VERROR's name.  The file must be VERROR.COM in the ROOT:
directory for VERROR to find itself.

Enjoy!
