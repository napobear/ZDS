ZS10.LBR contains ZSWEEP 1.0 which is NSWP207 disassembled and converted to a 
Z system utility.  It has full support for named directories the ability to 
execute or act upon the current file and a psuedo Z system prompt from which
you may execute any valid Z system command line up to 127 characters in length.
It requires ZCPR 3.3 or later with an extended TCAP as specified by VLIB4D.  
The current release does not support user areas above 15, due to the fact that
my system is Z3PLUS which does not support user areas above 15 so I was unable  
to implement user areas 16-31. However Bruce Morgan has graciously consented  
to assist in bringing this feature to ZSWEEP so expect it in the near future.
The release of this program has the blessing of Dave Rand for which I express
my gratitude to him.       April 5, 1991 - Pete Pardoe  Truro N.S. Canada 
