The new SHSET uses a substitute command separator ("&") which allows
SHSET command lines to be built into aliases and ARUNZ scripts. It
also gives somewhat more informative error messages, is obedient to
the Quiet Flag and places a meaningful value in the Program Error
Flag on failure.  Simple interactive mode and run-time "quiet" 
operation supported, Type 3 format with safety header, etc.
