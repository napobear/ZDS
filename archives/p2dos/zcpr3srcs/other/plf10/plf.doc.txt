SYNTAX:  PLF [DIR:]LIBNAME<CR>

PLF is a multi-purpose ZCPR3.3 library alias to be inserted in one's 
ALIAS.CMD, used to type, extract, and/or print up to three individual 
compressed or uncompressed members from inside a library in a single 
pass from its internal command line.  The compressed files may be 
crunched or squeezed.  They will be uncompressed during extraction.  PLF 
combines the functions of GLF and TLF and adds much more.

After loading, PLF will present you with a directory of the specified 
library and prompt you for the name(s) of the file(s) to view, extract, 
or print.  One, two or three filenames may be specified.  To view, 
enter either '/V' ('View') or '/T' ('Type'), then the filename(s) 
separated by spaces, i.e. as individual parameters.  To extract, first 
enter '/E', then up to three filename parameters.  A DIR: or DU: 
specification may be given on any or all filenames to which to extract 
the file(s), and wildcards may be used.  Since LT, the program that PLF 
uses for viewing library files, is patched to ignore all common binary 
filetypes, entering '/V *.*' or other file mask involving wildcards 
works quite nicely.  PLF/LT will type on the console each text file in 
the library and ignore all non-ASCII files.

To print, use '/P' instead of 'E'.  PLF will extract your file(s), print 
them and then erase them so as not to clutter up your disk.  If you are 
using the standard, shorter floppy disk version of PLF (PLF.CMD), you 
will be then be put into an "inspect" mode for printing.  If the file 
presented to you is indeed one you wish to be printed, you may type "Y" 
or <CR> and the file will be printed.  The longer, hard and RAM disk 
version (PLF-RAMD.CMD) works in a more automatic fashion and usually is 
able to select your files for you.  

PLF assumes with the printing option that you have no need for the files 
existing on disk outside the library and therefore erases them after 
printing.  Wildcards may be used with the /P option only if all files 
are uncompressed.

Finally, one often wants to extract and rename a file in the same 
operation, so PLF makes provision for this with its '/R' switch.  The 
first parameter after the '/R' should be the desired file to extract, 
with the proper DIR:/DU: spec if desired, followed by the filename to 
which you wish it renamed.  Be sure to specify the correct DIR: at the 
FIRST filename.  Unlike view, extract or print, the rename option will 
permit only one filename.

After any of these (optionally multi-file) operations you will again be 
presented with a directory and an opportunity to repeat the operations.  

CTL-C to abort when done.

A help screen may be brought up if PLF is invoked with no parameter or 
the traditional ZCPR3 '//' help syntax.

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

This alias requires ZCPR3.3, and will work without modification only on 
systems allowing the <SPACE> character to go directly to extended 
command processing.  Users with systems configured to permit only the 
ALTSPACE character ('/') should simply change the space characters.
PLF assumes you are running a version of ARUNZ that runs at 8000 hex.  
(see the GO command in P4).

You must also be using the Z33 flow control package and Z33IF.COM for 
PLF to work.  Your ECHO, transient or resident, should be able to 
display lower case letters with '%>'.

Files you must have along your path:  
-----------------------------------

Not supplied:  PRINT.COM
               RS.COM (RESOLVE.COM renamed)
               LT.COM (standard CP/M Library Typer)
               LLF.COM                                 
               SAK.COM
               LEX.COM (Bob Peddicord's new Library EXtracter)
    
Supplied:      S.COM (quiet-patched version of SHVAR.COM)
               REG.COM (quiet-patched ZCPR3 utility for use only if you 
                  do not have REG turned on in your RCP)
               RENA.COM (Terry Hazen's great RENAMZ renamer renamed)
               T.COM (My own patched version of TYPEL36)
               M.LBR (put this in your A0: directory, contains 
                  help file PLF, typed by T.COM)

My preferred message of creating and accessing a help message screen or 
status display is by making a text file and storing it in a file M.LBR 
that I always keep in A0:.  Then in my alias I read/display it with my 
version of TYPEL.COM renamed to T.COM.  This is short, very fast 
(loads much faster than making a COM file out of it with one of the text- 
to-COM-file makers and storing it in one's COMMAND.LBR) and packs a real 
wallop.  One can fit a huge number of help and status messages in one's 
M.LBR.  This is what I have done with my help file PLF which is stored 
inside M.LBR here.  I urge folks to adopt this method if they find it 
valuable.  My own M.LBR has perhaps 25 tiny text files that add greatly 
to the professional appearance of my aliases.  Using an ECHO command 
line directly inside one's alias is sometimes fine but quickly overflows 
the command line buffer for anything but the very shortest messages.

The file 'S.COM' provided in this package is SHVAR.COM renamed to save 
space in this alias, and should be placed along your path.  I am at all 
times in my alias-writing process acutely cognizant of the 200- 
character command line buffer limit, and I always do everything I 
possibly can to conserve space.  Renaming files is one of the easiest ways 
to do this.  I long ago renamed the ELSE command in my FCP to L; all my 
alias use this L command.  In a long alias using much flow control this 
can save a tremendous amount of space.  I have supplied in PLF10.LBR my 
own version of the alias in which I use 'L' for 'ELSE'.  If you take a 
look at P7 you see I can fit an extra possible filetype in there that 
overflows the command line buffer if the full name ELSE is used.  

I have done the same with my RCP ECHO command which I have renamed to E; 
I do a lot of ECHOing and status reporting and this saves me precious 
buffer space in long aliases.

I make use in PLF of the ZCPR3 register 0.  This alias works best if you 
have REG implemented in your RCP, and also that it be patched to not 
echo any console display.  Otherwise you're bothered by the display of 
numbers floating on screen as the register value is sent to the console.  
This can get distracting and takes away from the professional "feel."  
The easiest way to do this is to go into RCPREG.LIB and put a single RET 
instruction just before the routine "REGTEST01:".  I have provided a 
version of RCPREG.LIB modified in this way.  If you would like to have 
your registers set quietly simply re-assemble your RCP using this file.
Then if you ever want to have the register numbers echoed to screen as 
they are changed, simply rename your transient REG.COM and use it for 
those purposes.

If on the other hand, God forbid you don't have REG turned on in your 
RCP, and prefer not to for some reason, I have also provided a patched 
version of the transient REG.COM (do not distribute this) that will do 
its thing without displaying anything to the screen.  Setting the quiet 
flag in one's command line and running the unpatched REG.COM is not 
sufficient; it will not print its sign-on message but will still display 
the register value.  We want NO screen output at all; this takes care of 
it.

Have fun with PLF.  Please phone or write if you like it or have any
