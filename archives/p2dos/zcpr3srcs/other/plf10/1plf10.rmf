PLF -  A librarian's contribution to the library field.

Files in PLF10.LBR: 

1PLF10.RMF     This file - Read Me First.  Thanks to Terry Smythe for 
               the idea of using a '1' as the first character in a "read 
               me" file filename, a much better solution than '-' to 
               allow it to float to the top of a directory.

PLF.CMD        PLF alias for use with floppy systems.  Either this or 
               the following should be inserted in your ALIAS.CMD.

PLF-RAMD.CMD   Longer, more complex alias, recommended for hard or RAM disk 
               operation.  Prints in a more automatic fashion.  

PLF.DOC        Short doc file.

ALIAS.NOT      Longer discussion of PLF's innards and techniques used 
               in its creation.  Replete with general tips on writing 
               aliases (especially on saving command line buffer space), 
               discourse on using shells inside command scripts, the 
               ZCPR3 registers, looping techniques, recursive aliases, 
               and other assorted Z33 musings.

M.LBR          Contains help file PLF.

T.COM          Patched version of TYPEL36 used in PLF*.CMD to type M.LBR 
               for help message.

S.COM          Permanently quieted version of SHVAR.COM, renamed.

RENA.COM       Terry Hazen's RENAMZ.COM.  Thanks, Terry!

RCPREG.LIB     Specially hacked LIB for use with Z33RCP assembly to make 
               one's RCP-resident REG command not display anything on the 
               screen.  

REG.COM        Permanently quieted version of REG.COM for those who don't 
               use REG in their RCP.

RS.COM         Permanently quieted RESOLVE.COM.
