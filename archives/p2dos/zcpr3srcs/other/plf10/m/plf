SYNTAX:  PLF [DIR:]LIBNAME<CR>

PLF is a multi-purpose library alias utility used to type, extract, 
or print up to three uncompressed, squeezed or crunched individual files 
from inside a library in a single pass from its internal command line.  
After it loads, PLF will present you with a directory of the specified 
library and prompt you for the file(s) to view, extract, or print.  You 
may specify from one to three filenames, and wildcards are acceptable.  
To view, enter either '/T' or '/V' and then the filenames as parameters, 
separated by a space.  Enter '/E' to extract, and 'P' to print.  For 
printing, PLF will extract your file(s), print and then erase them.

After this operation, you will again be presented with a directory and 
an opportunity to repeat the operations.  CTL-C to abort when done.
