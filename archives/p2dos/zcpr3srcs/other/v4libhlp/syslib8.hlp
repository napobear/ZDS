:           Disk/User Manipulation Routines 

This is a set of six routines which allow the user to readily
move around between Disks and User Areas.  These routines are:

       GUA   - Return the Current User
       SUA   - Log into a specified User Area
       RETUD - Return the Current Disk/User
       LOGUD - Log into a specified Disk/User
       PUTUD - Save away the Current Disk/User
       GETUD - Restore the Disk/User saved by PUTUD


GUA and SUA are to be used to find out what User Area the
program is in (GUA) and to enter a specific User Area (SUA).

For example:

	CALL	GUA		; Find out current user
	PUSH	AF		; Save it
	 < move around on other user areas>
	POP	AF		; Get current user
	CALL	SUA		; Log into User

GUA and SUA are useful in conjunction with the automatic disk
logging feature of CP/M, where the first byte of the FCB
indicates a Disk to autolog (1=A, 2=B, etc., 0=default).


RETUD and LOGUD are to be used to find out where the program
is (RETUD) and to enter a specific Disk/User Area (LOGUD).

For example:

	CALL	RETUD		; Find out where we are
	PUSH	BC		; Save Disk/User
	 < move around on disks/users >
	POP	BC		; Get Disk/User
	CALL	LOGUD		; Log into Disk/User


PUTUD and GETUD are designed to be used as a place marker and
return combination.  They are intended to be used in such code
sequences as the following:

	CALL	PUTUD		; Mark current location
	 < move around on disks/users >
	CALL	GETUD		; Return to marked location

Since PUTUD stores the values in a single level buffer, multiple
calls to PUTUD should be avoided since GETUD will restore the
last Disk/User saved by PUTUD.

:GUA - Return Current User Area

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = User Area (0-31)
  USES : AF

 Usage:  This routine is simply used to return the currently
  logged User Area.  No error codes exist with this function.

 SUA - Set Current User Area

  ENTER:  A = User Area (0-31)
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  This routine is used to log into the user area
  represented  by the low-order 5 bits of the supplied value
  (value 0-31).  No error codes exist with this function.

:RETUD - Return the Current Disk/User

  ENTER: None
  EXIT : BC = Disk/User.  B=Disk (Drive A=0), C=User (0..31)
  USES : BC

 Usage:  This routine is commonly used to return the currently
  logged User Number and currently logged Drive in a single
  operation.

:LOGUD - Log Into a Disk/User

  ENTER: BC = Disk/User.  B=Disk (Drive A=0), C=User (0..31)
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  This routine is used to log in a specified Drive and
  set the specified User Area to Current in a single operation.

:PUTUD - Save Away Disk/User
 GETUD - Restore Disk/User Saved by PUTUD

  ENTER: None
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  These routines are commonly used near the beginning
  of a program or routine to save the Current User and Disk
  numbers for restoration upon program/routine exit.  PUTUD
  saves the Current Disk and User in a local buffer, while
  GETUD restores these saved settings to the Currently
  logged BDOS values.  The buffer used by PUTUD and GETUD is
  internal and not available for general use.

:SETDMA - Set the BDOS DMA Transfer Address

  ENTER: HL = Start of DMA Buffer to set
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  This routine simply sets the DMA Transfer Address
  within the BDOS and BIOS to the specified address.  Since no
  registers are destroyed by this routine, it is suitable for
  use within loops in programs.
