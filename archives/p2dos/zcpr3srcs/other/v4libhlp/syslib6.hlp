This set of routines provides simple I/O capabilities with
absolutely no side effects on any registers.  Direct BIOS
calls are used on all routines except for BIN, BIST, and BOUT,
so functions such as ^P (which are implemented by the BDOS)
will not work by-and-large.

The I/O capabilities provided by these routines include:

	Character Input from Console and Reader
	Character Output to Console, Printer, and Punch
	Character Output to Console, Printer, and Punch
		with Control-Character Processing
	Console Input Status
	Conditional Input
	New Line (CRLF) Output
	Capitalized Character Input

Switched Output is provided in this set of routines; these are
called the S-series of routines, and are complementary to the
S-series numeric print routines.

The S-series of routines is different from the other series
in that the S-series uses an external data byte to determine
where the output is to be routed.  This byte is referred to as
SCTLFL (S Control Flag), and its switching function is
illustrated in the following table:

	----- SCTLFL -----
	 Binary        Hex       Outputs to

	00000000B      00H       Nothing
	00000001B      01H       Console
	10000000B      80H       Printer
	10000001B      81H       Console and Printer

If you do not initialize the SCTLFL variable before using an
S-routine, output will go to the console (the default is 01H).


 An example of code using S-routines is:

	EXT	SCTLFL,SOUT	; SCTLFL flag, SOUT routine
	...
	LD	A,81H		; enable printer and console
	LD	(SCTLFL),A
	...
	LD	A,'A'		; print character 'A'
	CALL	SOUT
	...
	LD	A,80H		; enable printer only
	LD	(SCTLFL),A
	...
	LD	A,'a'		; print character 'a'
	CALL	SOUT
	...

:BIN - BDOS Console Char Input Routine

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = Character input from CON:
  USES : AF

 Usage:  This routine is used to input a character from the
  Console with normal BDOS processing (Echo, ^P/^S sensing).

:BIST - BDOS Character Input Status Routine

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A <> 0, Zero Flag Clear (NZ) if Character ready
	      A = 0, Zero Flag Set (Z) if No Char
  USES : AF

 Usage:  This routine is used to return the console input
  status via BDOS Function 11.

:BOUT - BDOS Character Output Routine

  ENTER:  A = Character to send to Console Display
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  This routine is used to output a character to the
  Console via BDOS Function 2.

:CAPIN  - Capitalized Character Input
 CAPINE - Capitalized Character Input with Echo

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = Capitalized Character input from Console
  USES : AF

 Usage:  These routines wait for an input character from the
  Console, capitalize it, and return it to your program.  CAPIN
  simply returns the capitalized character, while CAPINE also
  echoes it to the Console Display.

:CIN - Input a Character from the Console
 RIN - Input a Character from the Reader (Auxiliary) Device

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = Character from Console (CIN) or Reader (RIN)
  USES : AF

 Usage:  These routines provide character input functions with
  BIOS-level interfaces avoiding BDOS processing.  They are
  somewhat faster in response than their BDOS counterparts.

:COUT - Output a Character to the Console
 COUT7- Output a Character to the Console stripping MSB
 LOUT - Output a Character to the List Device (Printer)
 POUT - Output a Character to the Punch (Auxiliary) Device
 SOUT - Output a Character to the Switched (CON:/LST:) Output

  ENTER:  A = Character to Send to Output Device
  EXIT : None  (COUT7 returns Char in A with MSB clear)
  USES : AF

 Usage:  These routines are used for direct BIOS-level output
  within a program.  They avoid the BDOS character traps and
  processing, and are therefore somewhat faster than BDOS
  routines.  COUT7 is identical to COUT except that the High-
  order bit is stripped from the Output Character before
  passing it to the driver.

:CCOUT - Output to Console with Control Char Display
 CLOUT - Output to List Device with Control Char Display
 CPOUT - Output to Punch Device with Control Char Display
 CSOUT - Output to Switched CON:/LST: with Control Char Display

  ENTER:  A = Character to Output
  EXIT : None
  USES : Flags

 Usage:  These routines should be used to control printing to
  devices which may be disturbed by non-printing (control)
  characters.  They function as their primary counterparts for
  normal printable characters, but treat all ASCII codes less
  than a space (20H) except for <NULL>, <BEL>, <BS>, <LF>, and
  <CR> in a special manner.  These values are output as an
  Uparrow (^) followed by the corresponding letter generated by
  adding 40H to the character value (i.e. 1 outputs as "^A", 2
  as "^B", etc.).  The following values are output directly:

          <NULL>  <BEL>  <BS>  <LF>  <CR>

:CONDIN - Conditional Console Input

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = Console Character, Zero Clear (NZ) if present
	      A indeterminate, Zero Set (Z) if NO Character
  USES : AF

 Usage:  This routine is used to test for any waiting character
  on the Console, and return it.  If no character is waiting,
  the routine returns a flag indicating that no character was
  returned.

:CRLF  - Send Carriage Return/Line Feed to Console
 LCRLF - Send Carriage Return/Line Feed to LST: (Printer)
 SCRLF - Send Carriage Return/Line Feed to Switched Output

  ENTER: None
  EXIT : None
  USES : None

 Usage:  These routines simply send a New Line combination of
  Carriage Return/Line Feed to the CON: (CRLF), LST: (LCRLF),
  or switched output (SCRLF).

:CST - Return Console Status Routine

  ENTER: None
  EXIT :  A = 0, Zero Flag Set (Z) if Console Data Available
	      A = 1, Zero Clear (NZ) if NO Data Available
  USES : AF

 Usage:  This routine is used to quickly sample the Console
  status with a direct BIOS interface.
