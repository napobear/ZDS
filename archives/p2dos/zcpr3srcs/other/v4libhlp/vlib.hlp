		 Introduction to VLIB 

VLIB is a library of routines originally designed by Richard
Conn to support ZCPR3.  Many changes have been incorporated in
this version, including optimized code for the Z80 processor
family, conversion to a table-driven mode for increased speed,
and the addition of several new routines compatible with some
of the GRWLIB and GRXLIB routines which were never widely
adopted.

Programs using routines from this library are able to enhance
video displays with direct cursor addressing, video attributes
and new modes of operation such as Pull-Down Menus in a
portable manner among other Z-Systems without re-installation.

Portability is achieved by accessing terminal descriptions
contained in the ZCPR3 TCAP, or compatible record.  In most
systems, the TCAP is stored in the second half of the ZCPR3
Environment Descriptor.

                      Using VLIB 

When writing programs to use VLIB, follow these steps:

1. Initialize Pointers and routines.  The two ptrs needed are:
	- ENVPTR is the ZCPR3 Environment Descriptor Addr
	- VIDPTR sets the Z3TCAP Entry Address
	- If using Graphics or Pull-Down Menus, initialize
		that sybsystem as well.  This routine returns
		flags that tell what new capabilities exist

2. Call Terminal Initialization Routine, TINIT.  If your terminal
   uses DIM or reduced-intensity instead of Reverse video, TINIT
   should set the default to the Dim level as default, and use
   normal intensity for STNDOUT, with STNDEND returning to Dim.

3. Call VLIB Routines within the program as Desired

4. Call Terminal Deinitialization Routine, DINIT.  If your
   terminal uses DIM or reduced-intensity attibutes instead of
   Reverse or Intensified video for Highlighting, DINIT should
   restore the terminal to normal intensity at exit.
