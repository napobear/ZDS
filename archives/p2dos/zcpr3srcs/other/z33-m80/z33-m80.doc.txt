INTRODUCTION:

    The author of these notes IN NO WAY means to discredit the ZAS assembler, 
    under which ZCPR 3.3 assembles with no changes.  However, by habit and 
    personal preference, the author tends to convert all source he uses to 
    either M80 or MAC compatible forms so that the job of maintaining tools, 
    etc. is easiest for him.  Be that as it may, notes on how to convert the 
    RELEASE version of ZCPR 3.3 to a form that is digestable by M80 seem to be 
    of general value to the community - so here they are.

GENERAL NOTES:

    There are but a few changes necessary to the ZCPR 3.3 code.  These are:

     1) Changing [] pairs to ()
     2) Changing certain of the EQUs to DEFLs (only required when a symbol is 
        redefinded in the code)
     3) Converting the arguments of MACLIB pseudo-ops to UPPERCASE
     4) Changing the names of the FORMAL parameters in MACROS to be 6 or less 
        characters in length.
     5) Addition of an ASEG statement to the code.

    These changes are relatively minor.  If the reader is familiar with M80,
    he can probably effect the changes with the information listed above.  If, 
    on the other hand, the reader is not too sure he wants to tackle the job 
    on his/her own, read on.

    Since the changes are few, they are included in this library in a 
    DIFference format (the files with the extension .DIF)  These files, when 
    applied to the RELEASE version of the ZCPR33 files via the program SSED, 
    produce the M80 compatible files.

    The programs DIF2 and SSED are used to generate the difference file and to 
    merge that difference file to the original, producing the modified 
    version.  These handy little programs and their documentation  are 
    included in this library.

    The following files must be modified:

     ZCPR33.Z80  - the ZCPR33 source
     Z3BASE.LIB  - the SYSTEM-dependent base equates
     Z33MAC.LIB  - the ZCPR33 macro library
     Z33HDR.LIB  - the user configuration options file

    The files Z3BASE.LIB and Z33HDR.LIB present a small procedural problem, as 
    the user will be EDITING these files to install his system.  These files 
    *MUST*, therefore, be modifed BEFORE the user begins installation!  USE 
    ONLY the Z3BASE.LIB and Z33HDR.LIB (not Z33HDR1.LIB, Z33HDR2.LIB, etc.) 
    supplied in the RELEASE VERSION of ZCPR 3.3!

    BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN that you operate on the ORIGINAL, UNMODIFIED ZCPR 
    3.3 source code.  Strange and not-so-wonderful things may result if you 
    apply the .DIF files to modifed source code.

    Finally, remember to preserve your ORIGINAL source, just in case something 
    goes wrong!  In the procedures listed below, the original files are 
    renamed according to an arbitrary convention.  Choose your own favorite 
    way of renaming or preserving....but make sure you DO it!

DOING IT:

    1) Get the following files into one directory/area:

        ZCPR33.Z80
        ZCPR33.DIF
        Z3BASE.LIB
        Z3BASE.DIF
        Z33MAC.LIB
        Z33MAC.DIF
        Z33HDR.LIB
        Z33HDR.DIF
        SSED2.COM

    2) Rename the files:

        REN ZCPR33.ORI=ZCPR33.Z80
        REN Z3BASE.ORI=Z3BASE.LIB
        REN Z33MAC.ORI=Z33MAC.LIB
        REN Z33HDR.ORI=Z33HDR.LIB

    3) Modify them:

        SSED2 ZCPR33.ORI <ZCPR33.DIF >ZCPR33.Z80
        SSED2 Z3BASE.ORI <Z3BASE.DIF >Z3BASE.LIB
        SSED2 Z33MAC.ORI <Z33MAC.DIF >Z33MAC.LIB
        SSED2 Z33HDR.ORI <Z33HDR.DIF >Z33HDR.LIB

       At this point you may modify the Z3BASE.LIB and Z33HDR.LIB  file to 
       suit your preferences and/or system requirements.

    4) Assemble:

        M80 =ZCPR33.Z80 /Z/L

       (the /L may be omitted if you *DON'T* want a listing file)

    5) Make a .HEX file

       To do this, you'll need a piece of information from your Z3BASE.LIB 
       file - the ADDRESS of the CCP.  This will be the number equated to the 
       label CCP in that file (it is BC00H in the original).  Record that 
       piece of information and REPLACE the BC00 in the following command line 
       with it:

        L80 /P:BC00,ZCPR33,/X,ZCPR33/N,/E

       During the L80 process, the program *MAY* give an error report similar 
       to following:

        Origin above loader memory.  Move anyway?

       If it DOES, respond to the prompt with a N<cr>

PARTING SHOTS:

    If all went well, at this point you'll have a file ZCPR33.HEX on your disk 
    that can now be merged into your sysgen image the same way you did with 
    ZCPR 3.0!  What?  You're a first-timer or you forgot how to do it?  Well, 
    for that information you must consult ZCPR3 The Manual (available from 
    Echelon, Inc. 885 N. San Antonio Rd., Los Altos, CA  94022  415/9483820).
    There is also machine-readable (and downloadable) information on 
    installing ZCPR3 on several Z-Nodes.

    All should go well if you DON'T set the REL equate to TRUE in the 
    Z33HDR.LIB file.  Leave it off.  You don't need to use it anyway!
