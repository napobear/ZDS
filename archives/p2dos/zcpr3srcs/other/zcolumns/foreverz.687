Hello, Z fans...†ç


Due to the large number of extraordinary new software and†ç
†ç
hardware developments in our world, this is going to be a "newsy"†ç
†ç
column.†ç


First: folks in the San Francisco area are in serious beta-test†ç
†ç
of support for quad density drives for the Morrow Z-System. This†ç
†ç
is something not provided for in the original Morrow BIOS. If you†ç
†ç
desire more disk space but you've been holding off on buying that†ç
†ç
Mini Winnie hard disk for fear of creating a too-large hole in†ç
†ç
your bank account, an easy solution is to go with quad density†ç
†ç
drives. A quad density Morrow disk will hold 768k worth of files.†ç
†ç
Not as popular as they should be, they can be purchased for†ç
†ç
approximately the same price or just slightly higher than the†ç
†ç
ordinary DSDD drives. They're perfect for our Z-System which†ç
†ç
likes to have a large number of files available on-line. Best way†ç
†ç
to get one or two to either add to your two-drive system or to†ç
†ç
replace one of your existing drives is by mail order through†ç
†ç
something like Computer Shopper newspaper, available at newsstands†ç
†ç
everywhere.†ç

 †ç

Work on the MD2 version of our Morrow bootable disk has also†ç
†ç
begun; interested users should contact the MOR office.†ç


Next and most importantly. As if having available to us the new†ç
†ç
CP/M-compatible Hitachi HD64180 chip, the Z-System world is now†ç
†ç
abuzz with excitement about the new chip just released by Zilog,†ç
†ç
four years in the making, the Z280. The Z280 is downward-†ç
†ç
compatible with our Z80s, addresses 1 Mb of RAM directly and is†ç
†ç
capable of addressing 16 Mb with operating system support, and†ç
†ç
runs at 16 Mhz. The really big news: an add-on board for the†ç
†ç
Kaypro computer is in beta test and as of this writing (early†ç
†ç
April) taking advance orders for release in the summer. Called†ç
†ç
the ULTRABOARD this is one of the biggest developments in CP/M-†ç
†ç
compatible hardware technology in years. It is produced by High†ç
†ç
Tech Research in Redding, CA, the manufacturers of the Kaypro†ç
†ç
memory-resident Handyman add-on board/utility. Cost will be under†ç
†ç
$500. Installation requires nothing more than pulling out one's†ç
†ç
Z80 chip, replacing it with the new board, and attaching a new†ç
†ç
cable.†ç


There is a description of the product, released by the Kaypro†ç
†ç
users group at the West Coast Computer Faire here in San†ç
†ç
Francisco floating around the BBS circuit called ULTRA.INF in†ç
†ç
which it is claimed that it "makes the ULTRABOARD-equipped CP/M†ç
†ç
Kaypro the fastest, most powerful personal computer available†ç
†ç
today."  This claim isn't far from the truth. The Z280 chip†ç
†ç
easily approaches the MS-DOS-compatible 80286 microprocessor in†ç
†ç
speed. It has on-chip virtual memory and cache memory, and a†ç
†ç
user-configurable RAMdisk. It comes with a replacement for the†ç
†ç
Kaypro screen driver that makes it 25 times faster than the†ç
†ç
current terminal, and comes with an optional color monitor with†ç
†ç
which one can design one's own character set. The ULTRABOARD has†ç
†ç
1 meg ROM capacity, making it possible - again, with operating†ç
†ç
system support - for programs such as Wordstar to remain [BOLD†ç
†ç
HERE]:in memory[END BOLD]!  Can you imagine being able to access†ç
†ç
your word processor from any other program at the touch of a†ç
†ç
key?. This technique is approached with software by Backgrounder†ç
†ç
II, which I'll describe in a minute, which stores your first†ç
†ç
application on disk rather than in memory. All presently-existing†ç
†ç
CP/M programs are fully compatible with this new chip, but run†ç
†ç
with incredible speed.†ç


I mention this product not because it is likely that some†ç
†ç
enterprising company will manufacture a comparable product for†ç
†ç
our Morrows. Its significance lies simply in pointing to the fact†ç
†ç
that despite popular impression the CP/M-compatible world is not†ç
†ç
just "holding on" or "still here" but making bold new advances.†ç
†ç
There is little doubt given the low cost of this new chip and its†ç
†ç
minimal power consumption that new computers will be manufactured†ç
†ç
with it as its processor. The fact that Zilog has indeed†ç
†ç
developed it is proof of trust in the ability of the marketplace†ç
†ç
to support software for it. Though all presently existing CP/M†ç
†ç
programs will run, the real potential for both the Z280 and the†ç
†ç
HD64180 will come when Echelon finishes its operating system for†ç
†ç
these chips.  CP/M itself - Digital Research's product - cannot†ç
†ç
support the [UNDERLINE HERE: extra [END UNDERLINE] features of†ç
†ç
this chip, but the new Echelon operating system can. There is†ç
†ç
little doubt that when we have the OS we can expect software to†ç
†ç
be written. If and when we are able to find someone to rewrite†ç
†ç
the Morrow BIOS for the Z80's brother chip, the HD64180, we in†ç
†ç
the Z-System world and unfortunately not our CP/M brethren will†ç
†ç
be positioned to be in the forefront of these new developments.†ç


High Tech Research can be contacted at (800) 446-3220 or (800)†ç
†ç
446-3223 in California.†ç


Who knows what riches our future holds?  The superb MicroMint†ç
†ç
GT180 computer, running Z-System, the HD64180, and Borland†ç
†ç
International's Graphix Toolbox, is capable of color graphics†ç
†ç
superior to the Macintosh (see [UNDERLINE HERE:]Byte Magazine[END†ç
†ç
UNDERLINE], Oct.-Dec. 1986). Our April meeting of BAMDUA here in†ç
†ç
San Francisco is featuring a demonstration of the extraordinary†ç
†ç
new all-RAMdisk-based ON! computer, running of course, Z-System.†ç
†ç
The development team at Echelon, consisting of four programmers,†ç
†ç
is estimating a September release date for their large-memory†ç
†ç
operating system, to be called ZOS, for the HD64180 and the Z280.†ç
†ç
Echelon is in contact with software developers to begin the†ç
†ç
process of writing new applications -- as opposed to the†ç
†ç
utilities of which we have such a large number and quality -- to†ç
†ç
run in this extra memory. There is already a version of BASIC†ç
†ç
called 64180BASIC for this chip with full multi-tasking between†ç
†ç
programs, and rumors fly past my ear right and left of LOTUS 1-2-†ç
†ç
3 and DBASE III work-alikes. And if you can imagine the kinds of†ç
†ç
things you could do with a 15k Flow Command Package you'll get†ç
†ç
some idea of the possibilities opening up.†ç


We are at a crucial moment in our CP/M-compatible world. The†ç
†ç
economic success of all these various software and hardware†ç
†ç
ventures, and whether we can keep our world viable alongside the†ç
†ç
more powerful MS-DOS universe depends, quite literally and†ç
†ç
directly, on the willingness of each of us using Z-System to make†ç
†ç
and maintain a commitment to what we are doing and to the†ç
†ç
projects we are undertaking. Every contribution from each user --†ç
†ç
a small but nifty alias or ZEX script developed and released to†ç
†ç
others, a bit of generosity shown on a BBS, a phone call of†ç
†ç
appreciation to a programmer whose program you liked -- these are†ç
†ç
the things that make our world. This Z-System is an†ç
†ç
extraordinarily high-quality undertaking, some might say†ç
†ç
experiment, in which we are involved. It deserves to succeed, and†ç
†ç
succeed well.†ç


In this regard it becomes especially incumbent upon us to keep up†ç
†ç
with this rapid forward motion by making the required adaptations†ç
†ç
to the Morrow BIOS. Interested programmers are very much urged to†ç
†ç
contact me.†ç


Enough about chips and operating systems. Echelon has released†ç
†ç
the long-awaited ZCPR3.3, which we at MOR should have available†ç
†ç
by the time you read this. Among the new features are the ability†ç
†ç
to have an error handler and extended command processor†ç
†ç
simultaneously, automatic installation of new programs (no more†ç
†ç
Z3INS!), direct access to extended command processing without†ç
†ç
current directory or PATH search, and smoother running of ZEX†ç
†ç
scripts from shell programs such as VFILER. I've been running an†ç
†ç
early version of this for several months; it's excellent. Contact†ç
†ç
the MOR office about upgrades.†ç


Now to programs. What has been described as "the most†ç
†ç
revolutionary development in CP/M since ZCPR3" is a piece of†ç
†ç
software called Backgrounder II developed by Plu*Perfect Systems†ç
†ç
in southern California. It gives us "non-concurrent multi-†ç
†ç
tasking," with which a user can switch ("swap") back and forth†ç
†ç
between two programs without exiting either one, and potentially†ç
†ç
cut and paste data between the two as well. A single keystroke†ç
†ç
suspends operation of one application and moves into either†ç
†ç
another program or a large set of available resident commands.†ç
†ç
The same keystroke returns again, often to the exact point from†ç
†ç
where you left off.†ç


Developed by Bridger Mitchell, one of Echelon's team members for†ç
†ç
the large-memory operating system, BGii is available for CP/M 2.2†ç
†ç
or Z-System machines only; it is not compatible with CP/M 3.0. It†ç
†ç
is fully integrated with all ZCPR and ZRDOS features. Since the†ç
†ç
speed of the swapping depends on the media, it is not fully†ç
†ç
practicable on floppy systems. Swapping on a RAMdisk takes 0.5†ç
†ç
seconds, on a hard disk somewhat longer. If you've been†ç
†ç
considering joining the MOR group purchase of the Mini-Winnie,†ç
†ç
seeing this in operation may convince you. To try it out on your†ç
†ç
system, there is a demonstration program available on BBSes†ç
†ç
called BGIIDEM3.LBR which lets you test it out on your A: drive†ç
†ç
only. There is much discussion about this program on the Z-Node†ç
†ç
circuit.  The full program is available for $75 either from†ç
†ç
Echelon or from Plu*Perfect Systems directly at Box 1494,†ç
†ç
Idyllwild, CA 92349. I am working on trying to get us a bulk†ç
†ç
discount on this, but I cannot promise anything. A long and†ç
†ç
detailed review of BGii is available in a file called KUGEL.DZC†ç
†ç
on all Z-Nodes.†ç


Another product available from Plu*Perfect, and one that opens up†ç
†ç
great possibilities for Morrow owners, is DateStamper. For too†ç
†ç
long we Morrow-ites have languished without one of the real†ç
†ç
niceties of the IBM computers -- a real time clock. This was for†ç
†ç
one very good reason: we had very little software to support it,†ç
†ç
and there really was no advantage to it. Well, that situation is†ç
†ç
now over for Z-System users only (not CP/M). DateStamper is the†ç
†ç
program that reads the information from your clock and sends it†ç
†ç
to any program that supports it. We in the Z world now have a†ç
†ç
number of programs that support time and date stamping of files.†ç
†ç
DateStamper comes with a version of SD.COM, the super directory†ç
†ç
program, that provides this feature. We also have a version of†ç
†ç
VFILER, the general file manager most of us use daily, and a PIP-†ç
†ç
equivalent copy program called PPIP, both of which will copy the†ç
†ç
date and time over with the copied or moved program. An overlay†ç
†ç
is now available to read the time from DateStamper into PRINT.COM†ç
†ç
as well, and I see on the Z-Nodes new programs coming out on an†ç
†ç
almost weekly basis to provide date-and time-stamping to other†ç
†ç
utilities.†ç


Fellow columnist Mike Allen has been doing a lot of tinkering†ç
†ç
with a real-time clock he is building from scratch components.†ç
†ç
Perhaps if enough of us nudge him he can make something available†ç
†ç
commercially to us in some manner. The only clock I'm aware of†ç
†ç
commercially is the Kenmore Z-Time, which unfortunately runs for†ç
†ç
$100 fully assembled. Now that we have the software to support†ç
†ç
their features, it is time for us in the Morrow world to make a†ç
†ç
real-time clocks part of our regular and daily repertoire. I†ç
†ç
would like to hear thoughts from other users on this matter,†ç
†ç
especially those have installed a commercial clock in their†ç
†ç
computer.†ç


Odds and ends: if anyone is having trouble getting Wordstar's†ç
†ç
print functions to work, simply re-install with INSTWS.COM,†ç
†ç
taking care to manually re-select LST: as the CP/M List Output†ç
†ç
Driver. For those having trouble installing their terminal, MOR†ç
†ç
now has a new TCAP file with all the Morrow terminals. The MDT-20†ç
†ç
seems to be giving occasional people problems -- for help with†ç
†ç
this contact the MOR office. Lastly, both SuperCalc and CORRECT-†ç
†ç
IT can be made to work properly from any directory on a hard disk†ç
†ç
with the PUBLIC directory feature; get in touch with me for this. †ç
†ç
Also don't forget the MOR BBS (415/654-3798) for these kinds of†ç
†ç
problems.†ç



This column I'd like to talk a bit about another superb way for†ç
†ç
owners of floppy systems to cram as absolutely much as possible†ç
†ç
onto a single disk. Last column I mentioned using ARUNZ as one's†ç
†ç
extended command processor, and then writing aliases into†ç
†ç
ALIAS.CMD. This avoids taking up the 2k space that a free-†ç
†ç
standing alias unfortunately uses up. The other space-saver we†ç
†ç
have is in the form of a program called LX.COM, for Library†ç
†ç
Execute. Many of you will remember, back from our good old CP/M†ç
†ç
days, a program called LRUN. It was fine for what it did but its†ç
†ç
ZCPR3 counterpart is superb. LX stands for Library eXecute and†ç
†ç
allows a user to pack a number of ordinary COM files into a†ç
†ç
single *.LBR file and then run these from outside the library,†ç
†ç
from the operating system command line, without extracting them.†ç
†ç
Because of the way libraries eliminate wasted disk and directory†ç
†ç
space, this is a tremendous space saver and will be perfect for†ç
†ç
when MOR releases the Z-System for Morrow single-sided machines.†ç
†ç
†ç

For instance, the ZCPR3 program QUIET.COM is actually only 1/2k†ç
†ç
in size. However, due to the way there is a minimum "block" size†ç
†ç
on our disk operating systems, this file existing alone on a†ç
†ç
floppy disk occupies 2k of space. Put inside a library, however,†ç
†ç
it occupies just what it should: 1/2k. Or if a file is really 4†ç
†ç
1/4k in size, it would by itself occupy 6k. Put a large number of†ç
†ç
these inside a library, however, and it is easy to imagine the†ç
†ç
savings in disk space.†ç


You simply make a library file called COMMAND.LBR which is the†ç
†ç
name LX.COM will look for and put in along your "path" --†ç
†ç
traditionally in A15:. Into this file put as many COM files as†ç
†ç
you like. In Echelon's beautiful new catalog the author describes†ç
†ç
his COMMAND.LBR as containing 50 to 60 COM files, thereby saving†ç
†ç
over 100k of disk space!†ç


Now the trick to really save space on those floppy drives: a†ç
†ç
superb and rather magic combination of ARUNZ.COM, LX.COM,†ç
†ç
COMMAND.LBR, and ALIAS.CMD. Your ALIAS.CMD, by the way, should be†ç
†ç
getting really crowded with aliases by now; it's probably your†ç
†ç
most important self-created ZCPR3 utility. (Remember, the best†ç
†ç
source of already-created aliases is on the nationwide Z-Node†ç
†ç
network or the MOR BBS.) You can make use of both your aliases†ç
†ç
which you've put inside ALIAS.CMD [BOLD HERE:]and[END BOLD] these†ç
†ç
library-packed COM files while still keeping ARUNZ as your†ç
†ç
extended command processor!  Here's the trick: for every COM file†ç
†ç
you have inside COMMAND.LBR put an "index entry" in ALIAS.CMD --†ç
†ç
which can contain an unlimited number of entries -- pointing to†ç
†ç
it.†ç

†ç

For instance, say you've put XDIR inside COMMAND.LBR. You simply†ç
†ç
create an entry, "XDIR LX XDIR $*". Now here's what happens:†ç
†ç
you're on the command line and you type "XDIR *.DOC /P" and hit†ç
†ç
the carriage return. Your "command processor" looks first on the†ç
†ç
current directory for a standalone file called XDIR.COM. You of†ç
†ç
course don't have one since you've hidden it safely away inside†ç
†ç
your COMMAND.LBR. It then searches your self-defined "PATH" and†ç
†ç
still doesn't find it. It then says to the extended command†ç
†ç
processor, "OK, ECP, it's your job now. I give up."  OK, let's†ç
†ç
see...who's playing ECP today?  Right, ARUNZ. ARUNZ says, "OK,†ç
†ç
command processor, thanks."  ARUNZ throws the ball to its own†ç
†ç
ALIAS.CMD and starts looking again for something called "XDIR".†ç
†ç
Ahah!  There it is. It finds the XDIR entry. "OK, entry, what do†ç
†ç
you want me to do with this?"  It sees the entry: "LX XDIR $*".†ç
†ç
The "$*" means "take the whole command tail (and not just one or†ç
†ç
two parameters -- very important to include this symbol), so its†ç
†ç
sends "XDIR *.DOC /P" over to LX which finds XDIR and runs your†ç
†ç
entire command line.†ç


Be sure to make an individual entry inside ALIAS.CMD for each and†ç
†ç
every COM file inside COMMAND.LBR.  Don't worry if you have 50 or†ç
†ç
60 along with all your aliases as well -- it can handle these†ç
†ç
with ease.  My ALIAS.CMD is 28k right now!  It's quite a sight to†ç
†ç
behold these in action. You'll have fun experimenting with this†ç
†ç
technique, and the disk space saved is quite amazing.†ç


By the way, feel free to contact me at 415/826-9448 or 821-4345†ç
†ç
if that number is busy. I very much enjoy shooting the breeze†ç
†ç
about your experiences with this extraordinary operating system.†ç
†ç
Z you next time...†ç
