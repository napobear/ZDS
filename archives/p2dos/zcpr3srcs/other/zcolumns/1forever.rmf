February 23, 1988

I'm starting to think of history.

This is a compilation of my "Forever Z" columns that appeared in 
the Morrow Owners Review, may it rest in peace.  MOR had a very 
noble existence from its beginnings as a Morrow Designs- (may it 
also R.I.P) supported publication in April 1984 until its final 
issue in December 1987.  It was a gem, a treasure to all us 
faithful Morrow fans.  Thank you, MOR, for your support, 
encouragement, hundreds of interesting, useful articles, and most 
importantly for creating a warm, nourishing, nurturing community.

In response to the creation, at our urging, by Echelon of a 
special customized "bootable" Z-System disk -- we're talking 
about the ZCPR3 routines written right into the Morrow BIOS now -- 
I decided I wanted to write a column to support the many users of 
the new disk -- which, by the way, has sold about 125 copies at 
last count.  This column, entitled "Forever Z," was one of the 
most enjoyable writing projects in which I've ever been involved. 
Even greater than the pleasure in simply writing it, however, has 
been the satisfaction and fulfillment I have received from the 
sense of community of users it helped engender.  That column 
continues to bring me phone calls from users in all parts of the 
country who have been turned on, through it, to our wondrous 
ZCPR3.  Z has been a great love of my life for almost 2 years 
now, and to know that I have in whatever small way inspired the 
same or similar feelings in others has been a source of great 
satisfaction and pride for me.

So I've put my five columns, spanning the February through 
December 1987 issues (the last column was broken into two 
issues), into this library for posterity and safe-keeping.  I 
wish MOR had had wider circulation into the non-Morrow CP/M- 
compatible world.  In any case, I'm told that after initial
publication the copyright reverts to me, so dear world, they're 
all yours to read and enjoy.

These files have been crunched with the superb DateStamper-ized 
CR23D, and their dates of creation are appropriate.  I hope at 
some point sysops start using LDIR-B instead of LUX or ZLUX, 
because the display of this library seen through that program is 
as delightful as it is informative.  All references in the 
LDIR-B and UNCR text display to date of issue refer to the MOR 
issue date.  

In any case, like I said I'm feeling historical these days, and I 
wanted to get these articles out into the world before too much 
time passed by.
