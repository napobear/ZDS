Syntax:  BCOMP [dir:]file1 [dir:][file2] [/]

	File1 is shown on a split screen with File2.  BCOMP enables
	the user to compare the two files with any relative offset.
	With the built-in patcher, code may be moved from one file
	to the other.

	If no dir:file2 is specified, the second window is memory.
	For convenience, the file names are automatically wild-
	carded UNLESS the '/' option is used on the command line.

	This program is very similar in operation to VCOMP (for
	text files.)

	The ZSIG version has been slightly modified to adopt the
	Z-NEWS #809 "user interface" and to report the name used
	to call the program.
