Version 1.2 modifications February 20, 1988 by Bruce Morgen:

Used faster CRC routines from SYSLIB4, included type-3 safety
header, a few cosmetic touches, etc.  Programmer's might be
interested to know that I experimented with buffered file
I/O for ZCRCK and, due to disk latency effects, it was
actually somewhat SLOWER - moral?: don't bother with buffering
unless there's some kind of write (copy, filter, file transfer)
operation, straight reads with low-overhead processing are
(apparently) just as fast if done a record at a time.  The table
driven CRC3xxxx routines from SYSLIB4 (patterned after the 8080
prototype introduced a few years back by Frank Gaude' in DISK7),
on the other hand, are a truly substantial improvement - QUICK!

Version 1.1 modifications May 13, 1987 by Bruce Morgen:

Added wheel-enabled LST: output option, made ZCRCK a Z33 type 3 COMfile.
PRNDU is now internal, calling SYSLIB for output.  ZCRCK will now NOT run
on an 8080 or 8085.

ZCRCK is a ZCPR3-compatible version of Sigi Kluger's NCRCK1.  Most of what
is good about it is because of Sigi's design, his WILDEX sorting routine
and the CRC routines of SYSLIB.  ZCRCK1 operates much the same as NCRCK1
does, except that it fully understands the ZCPR3 environment and it obeys
- and displays - named directory and DU: references.  All patching has
been eliminated, MAXDRV and MAXUSER are now Z3's responsibility, display
of $SYS files is now a wheel-controlled function.  NCRCK split its hex
display in byte-size pieces (5000H became 50 00), ZCRCK's display is more
conventional, to conform with NULU, PPIP, etc.   Sigi's NCRCK1 notes
follow, I have taken the liberty of altering them where appropriate.

ZCRCK (Z-systemCRCK) is designed to replace the CRCK and CHEK programs found
on RCPM systems by combining both features.

HOW TO USE ZCRCK:

Simply type the command

A0:BASE>ZCRCK [du: or dir:]afn [L (for printed listing)]

As you can see, while the dir:/du:/d:/u: is optional, a single ambiguous
(or unambiguous) filename must be supplied.

ZCRCK will identify itself, print a header line and then process all matching
files. the output looks something like this:

A0:BASE>ZCRCK *.COM

ZCRCK, Version 1.2 (ESKAY-b/m)

Files matched:   3 in the [BASE] directory.

DU:filename.[typ]   CRCK     CHEK      Kbytes    Records
--------------------------------------------------------
A0:DIR     .COM     E0AA     BC47          3         22
A0:HELP    .COM     AFFE     E066         17        133
A0:GO      .COM     0000     0000          0          0

Done.

A0:BASE>

Enjoy!
