4.3 - 18 Aug 90 - Fixed DUSCAN, updated version to 4.3.		HFB
4.3a- 27 Jan 91 -						HFB
  Incorporated optimized modules from Joe Wright affecting routines GETCL1,
  GETCL2, Z3LOG and PFIND.  Added unique code for the ZFNAME routine deleted,
  although the entry point is retained, executing the ZPRSFN code.  ZFNAME
  code was larger and had some anomalies, this should be no great loss.  GZMTOP
  revised to return the address of the first UNUSABLE byte at the top of TPA.
  This causes it to be compatible with the GETMTOP routine in SYSLIB.  The
  returned address will normally be the address of the first byte of the CCP or
  the protect address of an RSX.  Updated HLP file.
