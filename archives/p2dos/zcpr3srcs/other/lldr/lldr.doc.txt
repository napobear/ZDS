LLDR Version 1.1 -- ZCPR3 Package Loader -- July 6, 1987

  LLDR adds the ability to read files from a library 
to LDR.  This is significantly faster than loading them as 
seperate files and since each package is less than 1k, it 
makes quite a lot of sense to group them in libraries.

  The idea of this new version was Jay Sage's, and I did the 
programming.
