XALIAS, Extended Alias vers. 1.0 -- Paul Pomerleau -- August 6, 1987

  XALIAS is the front end of Rich Conn's ALIAS program and 
the alias code of VALIAS.  An editor has been added to the 
ALIAS code, along with several changes to make it less 
cumbersome.

  The editor is a subset of the one in EASE.  You may 
change the keystrokes for any action with a patch utility 
or by changing the code and reassembling.  See LED.Z80 and 
EASE.DOC for more information about the editor.
