Almost every thing you need to get this RCP running is included
in this package.  In addition to what is provided, you must have
the following:

Z3BASE.LIB
MLOAD.COM

Get everything on drive B: and type in this command line:
ZASM SLTRAP.BBZ HEX;MLOAD SLTRAP.RCP=SLTRAP;ERA SLTRAP.HEX

That should provide you with a working SLTRAP.RCP.

So how does it work?

For LIST DEVICE:
The disk file is opened by the command
        LOPEN filename.typ
Where filename.typ is the name of the file to hold all output.

To close the file (Write the text to disk and finish the file
properly), the command is
        LCLOSE

For CONSOLE DEVICE:
The disk file is opened by the command
        SOPEN filename.typ
Where filename.typ is the name of the file to hold all output.

  The text printed on the screen will NOT be saved to file.  TEXT
WILL NOT BE SAVED UNTILL YOU HAVE PRESSED THE TRIGGER KEY.
Pressing the trigger key again will stop the flow of text to the
designated file.  You may start and stop screen trapping all you
like.  The default trigger is ^\.

Use the command
        KEY
to change the key which you would like to use a a "Trigger".

To close the file (Write the text to disk and finish the file
properly), the command is
        SCLOSE

Ok, Kids, have fun.
