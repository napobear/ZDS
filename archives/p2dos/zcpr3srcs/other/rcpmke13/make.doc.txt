	MAKE is one of the most powerful programmers RCP's
around.  MAKE is an extension of the FINDERR technique for
trapping assembler/compiler errors, and closely resembles Unix's
make.  MAKE may be considered as a super-alias with error
checking.  Concisely: MAKE reduces programmer overhead on complex
programs composed of multiple files by automatically scheduling
modified files for translation/compilation/assembly, and linking
the relocatables.  What this means is that you may wander among
the executable program's files, adding or deleting code, and MAKE
will ensure that the latest executable version is produced.
	If you believe in modular programming, you can now keep
separate modules in separate files, and only need to invoke MAKE
to create the executable.  Separating functional portions of a
program into separate files has several major advantages:

	Faster editor useage with the smaller program segments in
	 separate files.

	Faster program creation, since only the changed portions
	 are compiled not the entire program,

	Update propagation - if you change a library/public file
	 used by several programs, all of them can be updated
	 automatically - I create a new sized or featured
	 Z-System in under 2 hours.

	With only a single function in a file, a programmer can
	 concentrate on it and not be distracted by other code
	 sections.

	MAKE automatically aborts when errors are detected,
allowing the user to leave the system unattended while MAKE is
running, if you get to the linker, then no compilation errors
were detected.  MAKE was written to support the development of a
chess playing program and an advanced ham radio controller
program.  It can be used for any program ( I use it for
everything ), but it's real power lies in supporting complex
program creation.


        The command line is MAKE MAKEFILE ( type is assumed as .MKE),
with MAKEFILE having the following structure: ( See MKE.LBR for examples)
 
        SOURCE1.MAC | TRANSLATION STRING
        SOURCE2.PLI | TRANSLATION STRING
        SOURCE3.MOD | TRANSLATION STRING
                        .
                        .
        SOURCEn.FLE | TRANSLATION STRING
        #
        LINKER_STRING SOURCE1,SOURCE2,SOURCE3,...SOURCEn


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes and warnings:

 DO NOT CHANGE RCP's WHILE RUNNING MAKE, or your system will crash.
  MAKE changes the BIOS CONOUT vector and needs to complete to change
  it back ( Unix's Make also cannot be aborted ).

 NO SIZE CHECKING PERFORMED WHEN THE TRANSLATION STRING IS
   STUFFED INTO THE Z3CL.

 CAPITAL LETTERS MUST BE USED!! IN THE MAKEFILE.

 SOURCE.FILE IS FILENAME.TYP, ALL FILES ARE DISK&USER LOCAL OR
  PUBLIC.  ALL TYP's MUST BE 3 LETTERS OR BLANK FILLED.

 THE OPTIONAL SEPARATOR/DELIMITER ON SOURCE LINES IS |, any blank
  or tab will also work.

 TRANSLATION STRING IS FREE FORM TO End-Of-Line.

 END OF SOURCE/TRANSLATION LINES IS INDICATED BY #, ON A SEPARATE
  LINE.

 LINKER STRING IS FREE FORM TO EOL (126 CHARACTERS).  

 END LINKER WITH CR/LF


	    See MKE.LBR for makefile examples.

  MAKE.RCP	/PUBON
Z3BASE.LIB	PROTECT MAKE.MAC
  MAKE.MAC	M80 =MAKE/M/L

makefile area after linker string is available for comments, but
will use up valuable space in ring buffer.  Line up FileTypes to
check for 3 chars in type.

PROTECT clears all file attributes, this will cause the MAKE.MAC line
to be executed.

PUBON/OFF turn on/off public directories, since a new MAKE.RCP is
always created, this will enable ZRDOS public directories.  It's
not often recognized that ZRDOS has a better solution to public
files.  The poking of a few bits enables/disables public files,
the alternative technique of setting a filename bit CANNOT be
easily disabled.  Different public directories can be available
depending on the current needs.
