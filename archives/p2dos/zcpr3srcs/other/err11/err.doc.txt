	This is an old program designed to return the soft error count for
Heath/Zenith 89/90 computers with H17 or H37 drives. An increasing number of
soft error counts indicates some drive maintenance may be necessary. This is
particularly true with 96 tpi H37 drives.
	The original program works fine with standard CPM and with ZCPRx.x but
it fails under NZCOM,a self installing ZCPR3. NZCOM installs a small "virtual"
BIOS just under the real BIOS and replaces the warm boot vector at 01H(in 
page 0) with a vector to this NZCOM BIOS. ERR.COM uses the warm boot vector
to find the correct address in the real BIOS where the error count is stored.
The ERR source has been modified to recognize if the program is running under
standard CPM or NZCOM [NZCOM can change on the fly between CPM and ZCPR3.4].

	Most of you will just want to modify the ERR.COM file with DDT
or better yet PATCH or ZPATCH. Change the values at the following addresses
to match your needs:

	112h	ffh = running NZCOM OR standard CPM    /either works for
		00h = hard coded ZCPR3 OR standard CPM \ standard CPM


	11Ah,11bh = NZCOM NZBIO size(00 09 =0900h)

	121h	ffh = using h17 drives
		00h = no h17 drives

	127h	ffh = using h37 drives
		00h = no h37 drives

	130h	ffh = print CPM version message
		00h = do not print CPM version message	


	If you prefer you may reassemble the source file after changing the
following four equates at the beginning of the program and then assemble
ERR.Z80. Use MLOAD to convert the HEX file to a COM file.

	NZCOM	EQU	FALSE	if you are a hard coded Z3 or CPM /either for
			TRUE	if you have NZCOM or standard CPM \CPM!

	H17	EQU	TRUE	if you use H17 drives
			FALSE 	if you do not use H17 drives

	H37	EQU	TRUE 	for H37 drives
			FALSE	if no H37 drives

	VERMSG	EQU	FALSE	for no CPM version message
			TRUE 	to print CPM version message along with error
				count
