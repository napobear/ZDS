Program:        SNAP, Version 1.0
Author:         Rob Friefeld
Purpose:        Save image of Z-System package space into a reloadable file.
Syntax:         SNAP file[.typ]
System:         ZCPR3.3

SNAP was written after I decided I liked Bob Andersson's LAP a lot.  My
minor objections to it were: 1) no source code, 2) too big, 3) verbose.

SNAP saves an image of the ENV, RCP, FCP, IOP, NDR, path, and quiet flag
plus a small loader to the file named on the command line.  That is,
rather than installing itself, it writes another program to reload the
packages. The output file is about 2k smaller than LAP (and SNAP itself 
is about 1/2k).  Error checking is minimal.

Note that, although the space allocated to each package may vary, you cannot
load one size system over another with SNAP. 

I followed Bob's scheme of disabling interrupts, loading the image, calling
the IOP initialization routine at IOPBASE+9, and enabling interrupts.  If
that doesn't work for you, I would like to hear about it.

Usage:
        SNAP SYS        <- Save current packages to file SYS.COM
        LDR OTHER.ENV,OTHER.RCP,OTHER.NDR,OTHER.FCP
        SNAP OTHER      <- Save this version to OTHER.COM
        SYS             <- Reload all original packages at once.
        OTHER           <- Run the other configuration.
