DSLIB Version 4.5					11 October 1993

DSLIB Source Library.  The source for this library is released for Non-
Commercial use only.  It is Copyright (C) 1988-1991 by Harold F. Bower.

  The files in this library are compressed with CRLZH Version 2.0.  Included
are three ZEX files to assemble all modules under SLR's Z80ASM+ (ASMDSLIB.SLR)
and Al Hawley's ZMAC (ASMDSLIB.ZMC), and MicroSoft's MACRO80 (ASMDSLIB.M80).
Two Linkage ZEX scripts are also included for SLRNKP (LINKDS.SLR) and
MicroSoft's LIB80 (LINKDS.M80).  To use the ZEX scripts, select the appro-
priate ones, either copy or rename them to type .ZEX, and execute.  The
ordering of files in the link (library building) step is critical because of
dependencies needed in single-pass linkers.
