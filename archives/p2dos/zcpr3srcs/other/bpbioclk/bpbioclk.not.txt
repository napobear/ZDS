BPBIOCLK.Z80 Notes:
   This is a clock driver for ZSDOS1 tailored to the B/P Bios interface.  It
may be assembled to a MicroSoft REL file and used as a custom clock when
generating a "LDTIM" Stamp Module for the Non-Banked ZSDOS1 systems.
   Included in this library are the two LIB modules needed for proper
integration with the SETUPZST stamper generation program.
