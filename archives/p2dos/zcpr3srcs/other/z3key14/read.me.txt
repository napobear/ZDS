This new version of Z3KEY has gone through a general cleanup
and an attempt has been made to make it easier to install.
ZASM.COM is included with MLOAD.COM to insure that everyone will
have an assembler that will work properly.

I originally wrote the program using ZAS.COM from Echelon but the
bugs are starting to get to me. The original installation called 
for a REL file and ZLINK because ZAS doesn't seem to be able to make 
a reliable HEX file. I hope that this new version will be easier
for the many who have had problems with it in the past.

The Z3KEY.ZEX file automates the assembly process.
The Z3KEY.COM utility is now self installing requiring
only that the user enters the address of the Environment
Descriptor the first time the program is run.

Have fun and if you run into any problems the best place to leave
messages for me is the MicroMint board at 203-871-1988
