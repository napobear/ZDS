;  PROGRAM HEADER:  Z3KEYRCP.LIB
;  AUTHOR:  ARNOLD BAILEY
;  VERSION 1.4

; VERSION 1.4 General cleanup and improved installation for users.

; VERSION 1.3 adds the ability to compile key definitions from a text file
; using Z3KEY.COM. Setting delay to 0 will now cause an infinite wait
; after the supershift character for the next key.
 
; VERSION 1.2 adds display of present key definitions if KEYS is typed in at 
; command prompt. This feature is select by setting KEYDEF below to true. The
; reason this was made optional is for computers that use the high bit set on
; keys that are being defined. The high bit is used by the KEYS section to 
; split a definition into the key part and the macro part.

;  VERSION 1.1 adds controlled expansion rate off a macro. See item 6.
; 
;
;	This program header selects the initial values to be incorporated 
; into Z3KEY.RCP.  
;

;
;   0. ID
;
;	The following ID is a single character, displayed as a part of
; the RCP ID, which distinguishes this RCP from others made from the same
; base file (Z3KEYRCP.Z80).
;

RCPID	EQU	'A'

;
;    1. Attention Character 
;       
;	The following equate defines the Attention character used to trigger
;  a key definition input. Choose a character that is rarely used.
;

ATTNCHAR:	EQU	']'-'@'		;CONTROL ]   ^]

;
;     2. Lead-In Character
;
;	The following equate defines the Lead-In Character. This is the 
;  first character generated by the systems function keys or the key
;  choosen for the Super Shift mode.
;

LEADCHR:	EQU	'\'		;Backslash used for Super Shift mode

;
;      3. Delay count
;
; 	The following equate defines the delay count used to determine if
;  a function key is through sending characters. If set to 0 the delay count
;  will be disabled and the LEADCHR will become a super shift character.
;

DELAYCNT:	EQU	1000

;
;       4. Case Flag
;
; 	The following equate defines the initial state of the UpCase Flag
;  If not zero then any characters following the Lead-In character will be
;  converted to upper case.
;

UPCASE:		EQU	0		;No upcase

;
;	5. Table Size
;
;	The following equate defines the overall size of the key definition
;  table.

TABLESIZE:	EQU	890

;
;        6. Expansion Rate
;
;	 ADDED TO VERSION 1.1
;
;        The following equate sets the number of CONST calls to be made before
;  the next character is supplied from Z3KEY. This allows programs that clear
;  CONIN to still be passed macros instead of having them throw away the rest
;  of the string.

EXPRATE:	EQU	2		;CALLS TO CONST BEFORE NEXT CHAR

;

;	  7. Key Display
;
;         ADDED TO VERSION 1.2
;	
;	  The following equate determines whether the KEYS display routine
;  is included or not. If your definitions include characters with the
;  high bit set set this equate to false.

KEYDEF		EQU	TRUE		;KEYS ROUTINE ENABLED

;
;  END of Z3KEY.RCP CUSTOMIZATION
