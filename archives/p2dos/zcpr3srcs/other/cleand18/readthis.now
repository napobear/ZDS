If you are using ZCPR3 with an unmodified CP/M BDOS, read the WARNING.!!! file 
BEFORE you use this program.

Well, here we go again.  At least this time the errors were left over from
previously-written sections of the code.
Version 1.7 (which still signed on as 1.6--another slip) clobbered the system
if it tried to clean an empty disk.  This version will properly handle empty
disks.  It doesn't tell you anything special if it finds the disk empty--I
wasn't willing to give up the space just to print a message.  It simply skips
over the 'Sorting' and 'Checking' sections and goes directly to the directory
write.  This does provide a handy way to clean out the directory area of an
empty disk without having to reformat the entire disk, if you need such a
capability.
