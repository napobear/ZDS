If you are using ZCPR3 with CP/M's unmodified BDOS,

  D O    N O T    U S E    T H I S    P R O G R A M    A S    I S    !!!!

The assembled version of CLEANDIR included in this library uses DOS function 
37 to reset the disk and force the DOS to reinitialize the allocation map, as 
long as it detects no errors in the cleaned-up directory.  This is necessary 
for ZRDOS Version 1.5 and later (either by having the program do it, or by 
running DISKRST as the first thing you do after CLEANDIR finishes) , and it 
causes no harm (although you may detect a VERY slight additional delay after 
it writes the disk before you get the system prompt back) with earlier 
versions of ZRDOS.  Not true of the CP/M BDOS!  The unmodified CP/M 2.x BDOS 
has a bug in it that causes it to improperly reinitialize its allocation 
information when function 37 is used, and results in already-allocated blocks 
being assigned to new files.  Or, in simple terms, IT EATS YOUR FILES!.

If you are using an unmodified CP/M BDOS, change the definition of the 
'ZRD15' variable to FALSE and reassemble the file.  For you purists using 
pre-1.5 ZRDOS, this will delete a little extraneous code (not enough for 
another directory entry) and give you the previously-mentioned small (like 
milliseconds) speedup.

Sorry for the inconvenience, but I think most Z-system users have some 
version of ZRDOS, so I have provided the version that will best fit the 
largest number of users.
