                     Z-PLAN DEMONSTRATOR'S GUIDE
        HOW TO DEMONSTRATE NZ-COM AND/OR Z3PLUS TO YOUR GROUP

1.Introduction.
     First off,  we would like to thank you brave souls who've  taken
it  upon yourselves to distribute,  and demonstrate NZ-COM and Z3PLUS
to the other members of your computer club or user group.  The reward
for such activity is often intangible, however over time you and your
group  will  experience the beneficial effects of  using  NZ-COM  and
Z3PLUS on your computers. (For the purposes of simplification we will
use the generic term "Z", "ZCPR" and "Z-System" whenever we intend to
refer  to either NZ-COM or Z3PLUS.).
     If you are a first time user of "Z",  it will seem that there is
just  too much to take in at once to even gain a working knowledge of
the power of "Z".  Do not be dismayed,  your skill and "fluency" will
expand  as you proceed along the "learning curve".  Before  long  you
will have gained both the ability to use "Z" productively in your own
applications,  as  well as have gained skill in passing on the  know-
ledge to the other members of your group.  Between the "Z-Nodes", the
"Good Neighbor Z-Helper Program", and our offices, you have an incre-
dible  support structure to call on if you ever get  stumped,  please
don't  hesitate to reach for help when confusion does strike.
     If  you already are a "Z power user" and presently enjoying  the
benefits of "Z",  you may have already demonstrated your  "Z-System",
to other members of your group.  We still would like you to read this
"demonstrator's  guide" to ensure that you are clearly presenting "Z"
to to your group,  in the best possible manner.
     The  purpose  of  this guide therefore,  is to provide  a  loose
structure  or "script" for a clear and succinct presentation  of  the
"Z-System"  features  to your local Club or User Group regardless  of
your  own particular level of computer or "Z" fluency.  If you follow
these  suggestions,  your fellow members will find your  presentation
both  entertaining and educational,  and you will hopefully  motivate
them to buy and install the "Z-System" on their own computer(s).

2. Preliminaries.
     READ  THE  MANUAL,  READ IT AGAIN,  now READ IT ONE  MORE  TIME!
Ninety  percent of all the "support calls" we get,  could  have  been
avoided  if the Manual had been first read carefully beforehand.  Our
most common answer to this type of query is, "Read page # , please!".
Without this basic preparation,  you won't really have a clear  grasp
of what the "Z-System" is all about,  and more importantly, you won't
be able to EXPRESS A CLEAR PICTURE TO OTHERS. Practice installing and
configuring the "Z-System" on your computer as per the manual.  Get a
good  working knowledge of how MKZCM and NZCOM (or Z3PLUS) works,  to
the  point where you can explain its use clearly to another  computer
user.
     Gain  a  working knowledge of some of the basic "Z-System"  fea-
tures,  namely;  PATHS,  BATCH PROCESSING,  PUBLIC DIRECTORIES, NAMED
DIRECTORIES,  EXTENDED COMMAND PROCESSING,  ALIASES,  ERROR HANDLING,
HISTORICAL SHELLS,  MENUS,  ZFILER,  etc..  You don't have become  an
instant  "Ghuru" on these subjects,  but practice their use until you
can clearly express how they work. Continuing in that vein, practice
the  use  of the "Z" utilities that came with your system  disk,  for
instance:

EASE, ZEX, ARUNZ, LX, ZFILER, PUBLIC, VLU, SHOW, RENAME, COPY, ERASE,

                            Page 1





[Z-DEMO.001]


SALIAS, etc..

     They  are  important utilities,  and their  use  demonstrates  a
majority of the "Z-Systems" features.  The manual very clearly demon-
strates  these  features and how they work.
     Acquire, or write some simple "ALIASES", refering to your manual
for examples.  If you can,  download the following files for inspira-
tion  from  your  local Z-NODE or BBS if they have  a  ZCPR  section:
ALIAS#1.LBR, ALIAS#2.LBR, MYALIAS.LBR, ALIAS.ART, ALIAS.FUN, CMD.LBR,
POKE&GO1.DOC,  POKE&GO2.DOC,  ALIAS-JB.LBR, etc.. Between this selec-
tion  and  your manual you should be able to come up with  some  very
useful  and dramatic "ALIASES" which fully demonstrate the  power  of
"Z"!  Probably  the all around favorites are the aliases of the  "GET
100;WS.COM;POKE  0000  00;GO $1" variety,  which very clearly  demon-
strate immediately useful WORDSTAR applications for the less  sophis-
ticated computer user.
     While  still shopping around your local Z-NODE or BBS,  try  and
pick up some "pretty screen" (V)MENU,  (V)ZFILER,  and ZMANG scripts,
as  these  utilities  also very graphically  demonstrate  the  custom
"menu"  capability  of the "Z-System".  Look for  the  the  following
files:    JB-VFCMD.LBR,    JB-MENUS.LBR,    DEMO.LBR,   ZFILRCMD.LBR,
VFBX11.LBR,  VFBX12.LBR, etc.. Depending on your computer's own video
charateristics  and your TERMCAP file configuration,  you may have to
modify these menu scripts, and you may have to check your computer or
terminal  manual to insert the correct video escape  codes  whereever
necessary.  Its  worth the effort,  'cause nothing pleases the  cword
more  than  an  attractive yet functional menu  screen.  The  greates
single source for "Z-SYSTEM" applications,  aliases,  menus, etc., is
the Z-NEWS.000 files on your local Z-NODE,  There are over 9  volumes
of Z-NEWS chock-a-block with all the best info on the "Z-SYSTEM".
     Practice  using  all  of these "Z-SYSTEM"  features  in  harmony
together,  gaining a clearer idea of what's going on and why. At this
stage  it wouldn't hurt to invite some of your computer buddies  over
to have a look at what you've been up to, and practice explaining the
features  of  your "Z-System" as you run it through its  paces.  This
will  help you in two ways:
     One,  your  pals  might be able to point out and help solve  any
particular "weakenesses" or "glitches" in your system and its presen-
tation.
     Two,  the more "dress rehearsals" you have beforehand,  the less
likely you are to get "stage fright" and "dry up" come "show time".
     Prepare a Script. Write up on some 3" X 5" cards a brief outline
of  which topics you wish to cover and also how much time you want to
devote to each.  We have included a sample demonstration outline,  to
serve  only as a guide.  It's up to you and your members how long you
wish to devote to this demonstration and which features deserve  most
attention.
     Some presentations may last up to an hour or more,  covering all
aspects  of the "Z-System",  while other times you may wish  only  to
present a single feature of "Z" for 15-20 minutes or so.  The script-
outline  is  necessary to help keep your mind focused and  your  talk
from wandering off on tangents.  If you start to wander, so will your
audience.  Prepare  a  script-outline in advance,  practice a  "dress
rehearsal"  it in front of a "buddie" or two,  and bring  your  notes
with you to your presentation, to refer to during your talk.

     Prepare your System.  Make sure all your components are in work-
ing  order  and that you have all necessary extension  cables,  surge
protectors etc..  Bring a Back-up of any component that seems  dicey,
don't  forget  a  Software Back-up too,  especially some  spare  Boot
Disks!  If  possible check out the demonstration site in advance  and
take particular note of any special electrical conditions.
     Pack  your system carfully in waterproof boxes,  or  containers.
Cardboard  boxes  and lots of newspaper & rope will work in a  pinch,
but make sure you have something waterproof like plastic garbage bags
to protect your hardware from the weather.  Arrive at least one  hour
early.  Murphy's Law always strikes, it always takes twice as long to
get there,  and twice as long to set up. Nothing spoils the show more
than starting late.
