             Suggested Outline for Demonstrating Z-System
                         Short Demonstration
Setup and Pretest:
  Have the system pre-configured for your terminal.
  Have all needed files in your root directory.
  Set up named directories.
  Add the EASE error handler to startup alias (STARTNZC or STARTZ3P).
  Test automatic alias execution from ARUNZ as CMDRUN.

[names in brackets are for Z3PLUS system]

1. Explain VERY QUICKLY what Z-System is
        variously called ZCPR, NZCOM, Z3PLUS
        upgrades vanilla CP/M 2.2
        requires NO programming or patching
        very flexible; you can customize it to your style
        100's of free user-group programs
        Z-Nodes for help and sharing

2. "Boot" the Z-System from vanilla CP/M
        (have your start-up alias and configuration already tested)
        demonstrate that it really is automatic!

3. Demonstrate the most interest-grabbing features first

   a.   error recovery and command history - EASE
          make and correct a typo; recall an old command and
          re-execute it
   b.   point-and-shoot demo - ZFILER
          view a file; tag several and mass copy to an unused user #;
          log into that user number; erase the copies
   c.   more point-and-shoot - VMENU
          explain that you can customize it; demonstrate one selection
   d.   getting help - HELP [ZHELP] (use SALIAS as example)
          select a topic; move back and forth;
          explain you can write the text yourself
   e.   using aliases
          demonstate your favorite flavors of WS - with a single WS.COM
          file create a new alias using SALIAS; describe multiple com-
          mands
   f.   execute commands from a library
          using LX; using ARUNZ

4. Next, peek inside the Z-System.  Illustrate its major components,
   with explanations about how it really works.
        H command
          explain RCP, FCP, CPR concept
        SHOW [SHOW]
          display the major segments and commands
        MAKENDR
          make a new named directory; log it in
        search path
          log into another directory; give a command (e.g. SDZ)
          run PATH
        conditional execution
          go through the example in the manual

5. Finally, show how you can easily customize your Z-System
        TCSELECT
        Explain memory/feature tradeoffs; can have several sized systems
          If NZ-COM: run MKZCM; make small, large systems.
          IF Z3PLUS; run "Z3PLUS LARGE;H" then "Z3PLUS SMALL;ZSHOW;
          Z3PLUS"

6. Explain User Group ordering plan. Take orders and checks.
