FOR-NEXT.DOC                                                   June 5, 1987

	FOR-NXT2.LBR is the second release of FOR-NEXT.LBR.  It contains a 
modified version of PERFORM in which a previous (severe) defect has been 
corrected.  My apologies to everybody who attempted to use this as 
advertised and experienced some frustration.  I inadvertently omitted the 
two lines of code necessary to clear the Console Status Flag, but this had 
no effect on my system because of "improvements" made to my customized 
ZCPR3.  Thanks to Michael Broschat for having the persistence to convince 
me that something was indeed wrong with PERFORM.

	Having been reminded in this embarassing way of the changes I've made 
to my ZCPR3 code, and the original reason for it, I realize that probably 
very few other people make use of SHSET to install customized shells.  
Included in this distribution, therefore, is a tiny little utility, 
CLRCST, which will make it easier without having to modify your ZCPR3 
code.  See CLRCST.HLP for more details.

     The three files FOR.COM, NEXT.COM, and PERFORM.COM provide the ability 
to perform a single command or set of commands repeatedly, for a specified 
list of arguments.  The actions of these programs are:

FOR <args>  -  Establishes the list of arguments to be used.  These may be:

     o    Filenames -- wildcards can be expanded or not, as you choose.
          Filenames matching several different ambiguous specifications can
          be collected in one list.  If an explicit directory reference
          precedes an ambiguous name, all expansions will also include the
          directory specification. 

     o    Arbitrary strings -- these may include spaces.

     o    All named directories.

     o    Numbers -- all integers up to a specified number will be written
          into the list.  The limit may be specified directly or one of
          ZCPR3's numeric registers may be used. 


NEXT <var>  -  Puts the next argument from the list into the specified
     system (shell) variable


PERFORM <cmd_line>  -  Executes the specified command line once for
     every argument in the list, substituting the current argument as
     directed. 


     Complete descriptions, including invokation syntax and example 
applications, are in the ZCPR3-compatible help file FOR-NEXT.HLP.
