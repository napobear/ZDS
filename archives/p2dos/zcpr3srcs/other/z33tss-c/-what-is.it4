This is ZCPR3.3 in a can. Installed by Dan Jacobs for a NorthStar
Horizon computer Running NorthStar's TSS/C Multi-User software.
This version uses TSS/C's automatic MOVCPM to move ZCPR3.3 for any
size of memory or SYStem package size you decide to run at boot time
(GO CP/M). Very handy for when you need more TPA. eg. WordStar 4
The IOP package is not installed here because I couldn't find
any of the BIOS ASM files. Besides TSS/C handles I/O much much better
than standard CP/M BIOS's.
