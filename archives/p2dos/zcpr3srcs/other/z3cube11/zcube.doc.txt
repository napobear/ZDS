Z-Cube version 1.1 -- Paul Pomerleau -- January 21, 1986

Avantages over 1.0:
  Rotation bug fixed.
  Cube now shows "FRONT" and "INSIDE BACK" of cube.
    This makes comprehension of what is happening easier.

  Z-Cube is a simulation of a 3-Dimensional cube.  You may twist
it as you like.  There is a different color on each face of the
cube.  Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange and White.  Select the
color by hitting the coresponding letter and turn that side
clockwise or counter clockwise with a Return or Space bar,
respectively.  You may save what you have done, so that you might
return to it later, by hitting ^W.  You may exit the simulation
by hitting ^Q.

  This program also simulates a screwdriver, which you bring into
use be hitting ^S.

  When writing to disk, Z-Cube expects a certain file name.  You
mayt change this file name by using PATCH or DDT.  The file name
resides at location 141h.  You may prefix the name with a DU: or
a DIR:.  If the specified file is not found in the specified
directory, it is searched for by means of the path.


Have fun, Kids.
