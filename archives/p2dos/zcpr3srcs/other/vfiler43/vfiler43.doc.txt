     This is a version of VFILER (4.3) updated for use with ZCPR33.  The
autoinstall code was deleted, and tests were added for ZEX or SUBMIT running
before proceeding to run the shell immediately after invocation.  The code
was cleaned up in some relatively minor ways (numerous ADD instructions were
changed to their proper Zilog format "ADD A,value" instead of "ADD value", and
one absolute jump was replaced with a relative jump.

     The other significant change is that the code was modified to assemble
in its modular form with ZAS.  There is an equate in the main file VFILER43.Z80
that can be set for assembly using either ZAS (zas equ true) or the SLR
assemblers (zas equ false).  There are instructions at that point in the code
that explain what to do if you are using another assembler.  If your assembler
does not support ZAS's square brackets, you will have to edit the modules to
change back to regular parentheses.

     For a complete description of the operation of VFILER 4.3, see the HLP
file.  VFILER 4.3 has many new features and options not available in earlier
versions.

     I would like to thank the many people who reported bugs and forwarded
suggestions to me.  A special thank you is due Robert Frazier for his
assistance in preparing the new HLP file.
