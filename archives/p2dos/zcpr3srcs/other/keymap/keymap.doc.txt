-------------------KEYMAP.Z80-------------------------------

A Function key emulator program.  Allows 2-keystroke
expansion to arbitrary strings.  For use in Z3 systems
with at least 100H free space in their iop.

To use: Use the FIND program to locate your iop address.
Using Find's memory utility, check out where the free
space in your iop starts.

Decide which control key is the lead-in character. I chose
control-V because it didn't conflict with any of my editors,
etc., but you can set trigger to any value you wish.
(If you need to generate a control-V, just strike it twice)

Near the address 'strlist' is an odd-looking string '56789...'.
These are the function keys. Following strlist is the list
of addresses of the substituted strings. Thus control-V 5
results in the string \(* being input. (Unix fans know what this
does!) Likewise, control-V B sends the string 'black<cr>'.
Strings end with binary zero, and keep this part of the program
contiguous. The function key, if a letter gives the same result
whether in lower, or upper case, or in 'control code'. Thus,
control-V b, control-V B, or control-V control B all do the same thing.
