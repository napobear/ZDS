
                              W.COM VERSION 2.2

The following is a brief description of the changes made to W.COM version 2.0 
resulting in the current version of 2.2.  For further revision information see 
the source file W22.Z80.


VERSION 2.1 by Jay Sage

   Several bugs were fixed in the delay timing routine and in the 
   initialization of the previously matched filename.

   A "scanning for next matching file" message was added to keep up user's 
   patience when scanning large directories.

   A configuration/patch area was added to the start of the program.  The SYS, 
   NONSYS, and MSEC parameters were put into this config/patch area.  (See 
   file W22CONFG.DOC for descriptions of all the parameters in the 
   config/patch area.)


VERSION 2.2 by Rob Wood

   The major change in version 2.2 is that now W is not reinvoked as a shell 
   except when repeating a ZEX command or the INSERT flag is FALSE in the 
   config/patch area.  W now will insert it's reinvokation command into the 
   multiple command line buffer.  This will allow commands that are pending in 
   the command buffer (multiple commands that followed the W command) to be 
   executed after W has completed or is aborted and not after the first pass 
   through W.  W still uses two shell stack entries as temporary storage.  
   For example: 
       Using W version 2.2 (INSERT set TRUE) with the command line "W ECHO 
       *.BAS;ECHO DONE", would echo all of the .BAS filenames then "DONE".  
       With the previous versions of W (or with INSERT set FALSE in version 
       2.2), the first .BAS filename would be echoed, then "DONE", followed by 
       the rest of the .BAS filenames.
   When using ZEX, W 2.2 works like the previous versions.  This is because 
   ZEX processes all commands in the multiple command line buffer before 
   exiting and allowing W to be reinvoked.

   Corrected problem of file attributes effecting the next filename selection 
   by ignoring the MSB of the filenames returned from the directory. 

   Added an internal quiet flag, IQUIET, to the config/patch area.  It is used 
   to turn on/off display of all messages except install, finish, and abort 
   messages.

   W version 2.2 will now determine, from the external FCB, what name it was 
   invoked with and will use it to build the shell/reinvokation command.  This 
   means that W22.COM no longer has to be renamed to W.COM to properly 
   reinvoke itself.

   Normally W has to be located somewhere along the current path.  If running 
   ZCPR 3.3 and have the Z33 flag is set to TRUE in config/patch area, W will 
   now determine, from the external FCB, what DU: it is located in and 
   reinvoke itself from that DU:.  This allows W to be located somewhere off 
   of the current path.  WARNING:  Do NOT set Z33 to TRUE if running ZCPR 3.0 
   or older.  ZCPR 3.0 does not provide the U: in the external FCB and thus W 
   may lock up the system.
