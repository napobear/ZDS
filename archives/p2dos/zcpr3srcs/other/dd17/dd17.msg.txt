DD was originally developed for use on the MDISK add-on RAM
disk for the AMPRO Z80 Little Board.  It allows use of the file
attributes F1-F7 to select files to be displayed and to make
examining the RAM disk directories faster and easier.  It is also
a general disk directory utility for ZCPR3 environments.  I hope
it proves useful to you!

DD17 fixes a bug causing the named directory routine to be
stomped on during program initialization.  Other than the
revision level update, the DOC and HLP files are unchanged.
