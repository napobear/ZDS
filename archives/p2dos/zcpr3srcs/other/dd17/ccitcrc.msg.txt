The crunched files in this library have been processed by C.B.
Falconer's CCITCRC.COM (type CCITCRC for a help screen), using
the 'V' option to patch the last two bytes in each file with the
value that will produce a CRC of zero.

After you have extracted the files from the library, type:

	       CCITCRC DD17.*

BEFORE uncrunching the files in order to verify that the CRC
value of each file is zero (you will see 4 hex values displayed
after each filename.  The first two values will be 00 00 if the
file is ok).  Then run CCITCRC using the 'R' option to remove the
added bytes:

	       CCITCRC DD17.* R

Now the files are ready to uncrunch using UNCR version 2.0 or
higher.
