Latest Revision
---------------

Version 1.7 - 05/23/88.  See DD17.HIS for revision details.

===============================================================


Overview
--------

DD is a ZCPR3 Disk Directory utility designed to be as easy as
possible to use for routine, everyday purposes.  It uses a
(patchable) 'lower case' option flag character ('/') for easiest
typing and ZCPR compatibility.	For mimumum size, it has only
those options that I've found most useful for everyday use on my
own floppy and RAM disk system, as there are other directory
utilities that will display more specialized information whenever
that information is required.  It also operates correctly using
the GO command.

For use with large directories, as are often found on hard disk
partitions, the summary line appears at the end of the display.
The display is paged, and may be aborted at the end of any page
with a ^C.

An important (for me) and unique feature of DD is its ability to
display files selected by file attribute as well as by filename
mask.  After having used the attribute file copy utility ACOPY
for quite awhile as my everyday copy program, I felt I needed
something more specific than the ZRDOS utility DFA (Display File
Attributes) to check which files had specific attributes set when
I was writing a copying alias using ACOPY, the file copying
utility that can copy by both file attribute mask and filename
mask.

DFA displays all the attributes of the files selected by a
specified filename mask, which is very complete and useful for
seeing patterns of attributes.	DFA is less useful, however, when
you are trying to see which files have a specific combination of
attributes.  DD was developed to display the files selected by
the specified filename mask that also have a selected combination
of the file attributes F1-F7 set.

Since ZRDOS and ACOPY allow the use of the archive attribute as
an aid in selecting files to be backed up, DD can also select
only non-archived files for display (that is, files that have
been modified after having been originally archived by SFA).
This helps you check to see which files have been modified after
you run a program or series of programs.

Sometimes an archive bit will be reset even when a file hasn't
been changed.  When running dBASEII, for example, a database file
archive bit gets reset whenever the file is opened and read, even
if it hasn't been modified.  Knowing that you aren't doing
anything to modify a file and that DD shows it as changed will
help you set up a backup utility that won't copy long files
needlessly.


Program Name
------------

The easiest mnemonic name to type, 'D', is already used (by the
public domain 'WHATSNEW' program), so I chose DD as being the
next easiest to type quickly.  My own version is renamed to
'D.COM', however, as I don't normally use the public domain
'WHATSNEW' D.COM and prefer the shorter name.  A version with a
horizontal display default might be named 'DH.COM', etc.  The
current program name will be automatically displayed in the HELP
message without any patching when running under ZCPR3.


Installation
------------

The distribution version of DD is supplied with an AMPRO standard
Z3ENV address of FE00H.  ZCPR3.0 users with other Z3ENV locations
should install DD using Z3INS.COM and SYS.ENV in the normal
manner.  ZCPR3.3 users don't need to perform any installation.
DD uses the ZCPR3 environmental descriptor only to obtain the
number of displayed lines per screen.


Syntax
------

	  DD [dir:][afn] [/option(s)]


Options
-------

DD is designed so that you don't have to type the filename mask
'*.*' when you wish to display all the files in a directory and
also to select options.  For example:

	  A0>DD /AT  is the same as  A0>DD *.* /AT

HOWEVER - if you select more than FIVE options without using a
filename mask such as '*.*', DD will think that you are
specifying a filename.

This limitation is imposed so that you can still use a filename
mask to select filenames beginning with '/' as long as the
command line tail (the filename mask and option request) is at
least SEVEN characters long.  The wildcards '*' and '?' and any
spaces count as filemask characters, but the filename/filetype
separator '.' does not.  DD will accept extra spaces after the
program name, the filename mask, and in and after the option
request, so the easiest way to make sure you have at least seven
characters in your requests for short filename masks beginning
with '/', is to just add lots of extra spaces before pressing
<RET>.

For example:

	  DD /* /A<RET>       will display ALL files, not just
	  -->12345	      those beginning with '/', as it
			      has only five characters in the
			      command line tail.

While:

	  DD /* /A  <RET>     is ok, because of the extra spaces
	  -->1234567	      AFTER the option request.

	  DD /*   /A<RET>     is also ok, because of the extra
	  -->1234567	      spaces BEFORE the option request.


Options may appear in any order except that if both members of
the 'H' and 'V' or the 'A' and 'S' option pairs are selected,
whichever option that appears last will be invoked.


The default options are:

     A - Display all (both directory and system) files.  The
	  default display is directory files only.

     S - Display only system files.

     N - Display only non-archived (changed) files.  Files must
	  have been archived first.  Useful for file backup
	  purposes in conjunction with the file copy utilities AC
	  or ACOPY.

   1 - 7  Display only the files selected by the filename mask
	  that also have ANY of the selected combination of the
	  file attributes F1 through F7 set.  Very useful in
	  conjunction with the attribute file copy utility ACOPY.

     U - Display all files from all user areas OTHER than the
	  logged user area.  This is useful as a means of quickly
	  checking whether there are files in any other user
	  areas on the disk.  Any specified filename mask will be
	  ignored, but all other options, such as 'S', '1' - '7'
	  and 'N' will still further specify the files to be
	  displayed.  Displayed files will not have their user
	  areas identified as this is primarily a 'check'
	  function.  It is also a quick way to display the space
	  remaining on a disk with a large directory in only one
	  user area without displaying the directory.

     T - Display the selected files alphabetized by file type
	  and then by file name.  The default display is
	  alphabetized by file name, then by file type.

     H - List files horizontally, mostly for use with multi-page
	  displays.  The default is vertical listing, and may be
	  changed to horizontal listing by patching (see below).
	  The help message will always reflect the default
	  listing by showing both the default setting and the
	  appropriate non-default option.  Although only one of
	  the 'H' or 'V' options is displayed in the help
	  message, both are, in fact, always available.

     P - Send the directory listing to your printer in addition
	  to displaying it on the console.  MAKE SURE THAT YOUR
	  PRINTER IS READY BEFORE YOU SPECIFY THE 'P' OPTION OR
	  YOUR SYSTEM MAY HANG UP!

     R - Reset the disk system (for checking the directories and
	  free space on a number of disks in the same drive, one
	  after the other).  This can be set to be the default
	  condition by patching (see below).  When the disk reset
	  option is selected, DD prints a reset message at sign-
	  on:
	       (Resetting the disk system...)

	  The display of this message may be eliminated by
	  patching (see below).


Patching the default settings
-----------------------------

The following locations may be patched with PATCH, DDT, ZPATCH,
DDT, etc, to change the program defaults as explained below.  The
HELP message will automatically reflect the current defaults.


Location    Default	 Purpose
================================================================
  010BH     '/' 	 Option flag character

  010CH     ':' 	 File separator character

  010DH     00H 	 File listing direction.  Default is
			 vertical.  0FFH defaults to horizontal
			 file listings.

  010EH     00H 	 Default is to not reset the disk system.
			 0FFH defaults to always resetting the
			 disk system.

  010FH     0DH 	 00H will eliminate the display of the
			 disk system reset message.
