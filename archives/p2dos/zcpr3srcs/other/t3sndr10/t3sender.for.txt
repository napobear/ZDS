T3SENDER is a prompt-triggered sendout facility for the TERM III system.
Unlike T3SEND, which blindly squirts characters at full tilt without 
attempting to validate a clear command line to transmit to, T3SENDER will
semi-intelligently attempt to confirm a system prompt before doing its
thing and will report any error to the console and the Program Error Flag.
It also uses the "&" substitute command separator convention to facilitate
sending long multi-command lines to the remote.     April 13, 1988
