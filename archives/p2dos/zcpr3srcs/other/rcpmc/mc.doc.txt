; Command:	MC
; Function:	Multi-Copy:  Wild Card File Copier
; Author: 	Rob Friefeld, 4607 Colorado St., Long Beach, CA 213-434-7338
; Date:		23 Aug 1987 Version 1.0

; Comment:	ERAON = YES assures all routines needed in  rcpsubs.lib 
;		are available.

; Usage:	MC SOURCE [DESTINATION]    i.e. MC WHAT WHERE
;		Source is the afn to be copied and destination is an optional
;		afn.  If omitted, source comes to current DU:
;		R/O files are copied to R/W.

; MC EQUATES

; # RECORDS TO READ ON EACH PASS (Byte value)

FILELOC	EQU	TPA	; Location file read in
RECBLKS	EQU	255	; About 32k buffer.  Leaves transient at 8000h alone.


IF the file is less than 32k size, AND if it is a program that executes at
100h, then a MC and GO will work.  Note that Z33 tools which work at 8000h
will leave the copied code alone, and vice versa.

EXAMPLES:

MC ROOT:LZED.COM TOP:ED.COM
	Copies file with rename from ROOT: to TOP: (e.g. on ram disk)
MC LIB:*.REL
	Fetches all .rel files from the LIB: directory to current DU:
MC *.* BAKUP:
	Sends everything from current DU: to BAKUP: directory

Wild card rename also works but may be dangerous to your mental health.
MC TEST.* a0:DONE.*

This program is about the same as one I wrote earlier called PIPE (for
the similarity to PIP).  The shorter name has been used here for convenience.
