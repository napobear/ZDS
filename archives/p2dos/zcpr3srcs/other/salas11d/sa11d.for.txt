SALIAS 1.1d Update - 31 March 88

Files:
	SALIAS11.COM  - Program with help screen.
	SALIAS11.HLP  - Documentation.

Version 1.1d:
     Minor cosmetic changes
	- user interface consistency recommendations of Z-NEWS 809
	- filename report shows named directory in brackets
	- syntax message uses current program name ("intelligent help")

Changes from version 1.0:

   - Horizontal scrolling for long commands.  The previous
	system of concatenating lines with the ^P+ trigger
	is retained for those who prefer to see all of the
	script on screen.  Each line can hold 255 chars.
   - Improved logic on reading, writing, renaming files.
   - The print routine takes the printer width from the ENV,
	and shows control chars in ^n format.
   - Oversized scripts can be saved, provided there is room
	for them in the ALIAS program (100h chars).
   - Fixed bug on reading from an empty file.
   - Fixed bug on DEL LEFT when at start of line 1.
   - Several changes to clean up screen performance.


Assembly:
   An assembly option to use the ZCPR3.3 SCAN routine for
	file name input.  The distributed version DOES NOT
	require ZCPR3.3.
   The source code is written for the SLR assembler.
   	ACCEPT statements are used to control the assembly options
   	for Z33 filename parsing and help screen inclusion.
