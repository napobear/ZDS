; Version 1.1 modifications by Bruce Morgen, September 12, 1988
; Installed character delay code like PAGE has, fixed command
; name print routine to strip high bits.  Re-implemented Howard
; Goldstein's more frequent pause checking, although I kludged
; my own code for it, no longer "owning" the LT source.  Made
; disabling of paging with Control-Z a toggle rather than a
; permanent cancellation.  Disallowed wildcards within LBR file
; specifications under CP/M 3.x (for Z3PLUS users).  Truncated
; long Z3LIB/SYSLIB symbol names to 6 characters so RMAC could
; by used in addition to M80 or SLRMAC, rebuilt UNC.REL to use
; the public symbol "UNCOUT" instead of "OUT", which is a taboo
; reserved word for RMAC.  There are now two sample assembly
; aliases, M80ZLT (M80 and ZLINK) and RMACZLT (RMAC and LINK).
; Note:
;	For unmodified RMAC, rename to ZLTxx.ASM before running
; 	RMACZLT.

; December 15, 1987, ZLT Version 1.0
;
; LT was always a marginal file extraction tool at best, so I've spun
; off ZLT as a typer-only program -- for ZCPR3-compatible systems
; only.  Use Bob Peddicord's LBREXT for extraction-with-uncompression
; chores.  Eliminating the parser code in favor of a simple Z3LOG
; call shrinks ZLT to very manageable proportions, while ZCPR 3.3
; takes care of security matters very competently.  Filetype exclu-
; sion is the one remaining assembly-time option of any significance,
; line count limits are still overridden by a non-zero wheel byte.
;
; ZLT is basically a Z-ified LT23 with file extraction and parsing
; code removed and one significant feature added: ZLT handles wild-
; card filespecs for files in the same manner as for LBR members --
; LT23 simply settled for the first matching file found by BDOS.
; The help message routine has been heavily modified to show the
; actual name of the program and the options available to the user.
; Other displays screwed up by questionable conditional assemblies
; in LT2x.MAC have also been (or seem to be) fixed.  ZLT now appears
; to be fully re-entrant, even from a help-message-only run.
;
; In deferrence to the formidable Prof. Falconer, ZLT remains coded
; in Intel mnemonics and 8080-compatible opcodes for M80 (SLRMAC will
; undoubtedly handle it just fine too) - use Irv Hoff's XIZ tool to
; translate it for Zilog-only assemblers.  Linkage with L80 is possi-
; ble, I suppose, but Echelon's ZLINK (or DRI's LINK) is much better
; for that job.  Use the ASMZLT alias (for M80 and ZLINK) as a model.
; In addition to the UNC and WILDEX modules, you'll also need Z3LIB
; and SYSLIB - almost any vintage of these should be OK.  Make sure
; to use Z3INS or Z-RIP on ZLT.COM if you still run ZCPR 3.0, or if
; you intend to use ZLT with a generic-CP/M CCP emulator like LUX77B.
;
; To accommodate a ZCPR3 header, the remaining option bytes start at
; 10Bh, followed by the filetype exclusion table.  Zeroes at the
; three active bytes turn off linecount limits, filetype exclusion and
; control-character filtering, in that order.

;
; Revision history of LT (Library Typer) by C.B. Falconer follows:
;____________________________________________________________________
;
; 08/12/87  Fixed to properly handle 0-length files.  Modified to
;   v23     check for pause and abort from console after every typed
;	    character rather than at the end of each line.  This was
;	    necessary to prevent loss of data on some very slow
;	    terminals such as the one I use, and to enable the typing
;	    of a file with no linefeeds to be aborted.	Also fixed the
;	    tab expansion routine to work correctly with files con-
;	    taining unusual control characters such as backspace, and
;	    made the "turn up one line" feature more foolproof.
;					- Howard Goldstein
;
; 07/30/87  Added the long needed ZCPR/ZCMD support of maximum user
;   v22     area.  When the UZCPR option is set, the page 0 value
;	    will be examined to determine if the requested user area
;	    is within the allowable range.  This is primarily useful
;	    on RCP/M's (but I suspect that is where LT is primarily
;	    used).  Added code to allow overriding the line counter
;	    and user area restrictions when the wheel is active.
;					- Gary Inman, Sysop
;					  West Los Angeles RCP/M
;
; 07/21/87  When at a [more] pause, the space bar now turns up one
;   v21     line at a time.  LTxx is often used on RCPM systems as
;	    their general purpose TYPE.COM program.  This makes it
;	    compatible with UNARC16.  These two  programs are used
;	    in the popular LUX program to type ASCII files in ARC,
;	    ARK or LBR files.  I have always liked this feature in
;	    UNARC16 and decided to add it to LT20.  I believe most
;	    users will find this quite useful and hope JB Falconer
;	    does not mind my adding this feature.  This version is
;	    a little over 4k.  If this makes any problem, just use
;	    an earlier version. 	- Irv Hoff, Sysop
;					  PRACSA RCPM
;
; 07/17/87  Able to use wheel byte in conjunction with OUTFLG flag.
;   v20     One byte added in ddt modifiable area at program start.
;	    WHLFLG and/or WHEEL now tested in conjunction with the
;	    OUTFLG flag eliminating need for two copies of program
;	    when used on a remote system.  Found that it would not
;	    assemble properly using M80/L80 because of YES/NO, now
;	    corrected.	Restored program name, version number, and
;	    author credit. Other minor mods to keep code size <4k.
;					- G.F. Reding [72436,45]
;
; 06/10/87  Change to only display characters between "[" and "]" in
;   v19     the header of crunched files as other characters in this
;	    area are reserved.	Removed the redundant "IF NOT UNCR"
;	    (marked ";;;;") following an "ELSE" which prevented LT18
;	    from being assembled in its distributed form. Slight text
;	    changes to keep <4k.	- Steven Greenberg
;
; 12/28/86  Allows access to .LBR files > 512k.  Was using CPM 1.4
;   v18     variety of direct access.  Mods to keep under 4k total.
;	    Should CP/M v1.4 check and refusal.
