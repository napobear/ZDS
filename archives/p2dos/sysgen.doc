SYSGEN -- free SYSGEN replacement (source+executable)

For those who do not own a DR CP/M license, it is not too hard to find a 
free CCP, BDOS and hack their own BIOS.  Getting equivalents of the 
standard CP/M commands is not quite as easy.  In particular, I needed 
SYSGEN to build a CP/M boot image without a cross development system.  
There is SGEN2, a SYSGEN replacement, but it requires M80 and some macro 
libraries and even worse, it has at least one bug: It assumes that the 
BIOS will only look at the C register when setting a track, but as a 
matter of fact many BIOSes use BC to allow more than 255 tracks.  
Further it allows to enter the number of system tracks.  This is 
an improvement over DR SYSGEN, but it would be more portable to 
read the DPB.

For that reason, I translated SGEN2 to ZSM assembler syntax (ZSM is 
available from the archives) and hacked it.  I call the result 
SYSGEN, because that's its name.

The library SYSGEN.LBR contains:

SYSGEN.Z   -- assembler source
SYSGEN.DOC -- this file
SYSGEN.SUB -- SUBMIT file to assemble and link SYSGEN
SYSGEN.COM -- the resulting COM file
