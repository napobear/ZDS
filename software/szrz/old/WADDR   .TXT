szrz100.lbr     X/Y/ZModem send/receive from command line CP/M3

Programs for CP/M 3 only
sz / rz are a pair of programs send or receive files in X/Y/ZModem
protocol. The function is like the wellknown UNIX tools.
The only condition: a modem (nullmodem) is connected to the AUX device.
Get help with sz -? or rz -?
The actual versions in this library are sz v1.11, rz v1.04
