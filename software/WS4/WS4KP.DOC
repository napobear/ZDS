I just upgraded WordStar for my Kaypro 4 (1984 version) to 
version 4.0 (CP/M Edition). I found that the appearance on my 
Kaypro screen left much to be desired: dim characters were the 
unreadable default, and the bright reverse video for messages was 
irritating. Why couldn't they have done it the same as 3.3 was 
originally shipped with my Kaypro with neat dim reverse video? 
Who knows? Anyway, I figured out how to use the WSCHANGE facility 
to fix it. This document describes how you can install my changes 
on your CP/M WS 4.0 too. I've also thrown in a couple of non-
obvious patches that I've found to be useful in editing.

At the bottom of this file you will find patch text input for one 
of the installation utilities provided on your disks. Using your 
editor, cut this section out from just below the "====" line to 
the end of the file, and write it as PATCH.TXT on the disk where 
you will be installing WordStar.

Run WSCHANGE provided on your installation disk.

Request to install WS, making the installed file WS4 so you don't 
overwrite the original WS. (If you've already overwritten WS.COM 
on your installation disk, better get another copy from your 
original master disks.)

Go through the Console menu and make your Monitor Selection to be 
"Kaypro 2X/4X". It will ask you if you want to change the arrow 
keys. Reply "N".

Now go back to the main menu and select the Patching section. 
Choose the Auto Patcher, to read patches from a file.

Enter PATCH.TXT as the file name and watch while it installs the 
patches.

When it is done, you can make any other changes you want, or you 
can exit back through the menus and complete writing out your new 
WS4.COM. 

To run it, remember it is now called WS4, not WS.

The patched version should look a lot better on your screen. It 
won't look exactly like version 3.3 did because they have changed 
things beyond what this patch can fix, but I've found it 
workable. See the notes below on what the other patches I've 
included do.

-- Notes on the patches --

CRTID is just the name of your computer at startup of WS4.
ERASCR is the inital erase screen command string.
VIDATT is the custom video attribute routine assembled from 
    WS4K4.ASM which is available on this SIG for further 
    customization if you desire. Note: with this routine 
    installed, the BRITE flag will be ignored, because it isn't 
    particularly useful anyway with this patch.
RLRVID specifies the ruler line as a message so it will appear in 
     reverse video.
MOVCHR is a table that defines which characters are considered 
    part of a word for moving around them (^F, ^A, ^T etc.). With 
    these settings, most special characters won't be skipped or 
    deleted when you edit programs. In version 3.3, a single ^T 
    while the cursor was on ALPHA=BRAVO+CHARLIE-DELTA(ECHO) 
    deleted the whole thing. If you liked the way WS 3.3 worked, 
    take this patch out by deleting its two lines. You can modify 
    this table yourself in WSCHANGE under "Lines and Characters."
DDISK specifies a shorter delay to hold off from disk access 
    while typing.
VMSIZE, EDSIZE, TYSIZE, HANMAX, and BFSIZE specify buffer sizes 
    that allow a larger file to be edited before WS has to swap 
    on disk. (Still, 4.0 has to swap with a lot smaller file than 
    WS 3.3 did.)
DLONG, DMED and DSHORT specify the length of delays WS uses 
    before it does things like display menus. I like them all 
    half as long as the defaults.

Below this bar are the patch instructions to WSCHANGE.
